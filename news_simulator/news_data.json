The operating margin was 16.4% of sales, consistent with the prior-year quarter.\u00a0\n\"A projected year-over-year decline in U.S. net farm income, combined with high input costs and increasing interest rates, negatively impacted unit sales volume in our irrigation business,\" Wood added.\u00a0\nThe company exited the quarter with $144.4 million in cash and equivalents. Long-term debt as of quarter end totaled $115.21 million.\nAs of May 31, 2023, the backlog of unfilled orders was $94.5 million compared with $98.3 million a year ago.\nOutlook:\u00a0The company expects sales volume in Brazil to increase in the fourth quarter, supported by the new government financing program that was recently announced.\u00a0\nDemand across other international markets continues to be supported by positive agricultural market fundamentals and continuing global concerns over food security and global grain supplies.\nPrice Action:\u00a0LNN shares are trading lower by 6.54% at $116.56 on the last check Thursday.\n",

      "body": "Heritage Cannabis Holdings Corp. (OTCQX:HERTF) (CSE:CANN) released its financial results as at and for the three months ended April 30, 2023, revealing net revenue of CA$7.4 million ($5.6 million), a decrease of 1.5% compared to CA$7.5 million in Q2 FY 2022.\nQ2 2023 Financial Highlights\n\n\nGross margin was CA$3.3 million compared to CA$3.2 million for the three months ended April 30, 2022. The increase in gross margin of CA$119,852 was primarily a result of improved production efficiencies in addition to a lower excise rate of 27.4% compared to 28.3% in the prior period which was driven by increased bulk B2B sales which provides less exposure to excise taxes.\n\n\n\n\nComprehensive loss of CA$2 million or CA$0.00 loss per share compared to a comprehensive loss of CA$500,614 or CA$0.00 loss per share for the three months ended April 30, 2022. The increase in comprehensive loss of CA$1.5 million during this period was attributable to higher interest costs as a result of rising interest rates and unrealized losses on derivative liabilities as a result of revaluations.\n\n\nCash at the end of the period was CA$4 million.\n\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to have achieved gross margin growth once again this quarter, despite the lack of much needed regulatory changes within the industry in Canada. We have remained extremely focused on managing our costs and quarterly burn-rate while harnessing a continuous improvement approach to maximize our product output\u201d, stated David Schwede, CEO of Heritage. \u201cOur entry into the U.S. market is performing well with both our Missouri and West Virginia facilities gaining a strong foothold in their respective markets, and with our RAD brand launching in New York this summer we are building out our capital efficient footprint in the U.S. Similar to our growing relationship with an Australian firm, we continue to evaluate new international markets to introduce our portfolio of in-demand products.\u201d\nPhoto by Esteban L\u00f3pez on Unsplash \nRelated News\nCanadian Cannabis Company Is Shipping 15,000 Live Resin Cartridges To Australia\nWho Is Who In Cannabis: Latest Industry Appointments You Should Know About\nHeritage Entering The Recreational Cannabis-Infused Beverage Market In Canada\n",

      "body": "Apparel and footwear company Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) will report fourth-quarter financial results after market close Thursday. Here\u2019s a look at the expectations from analysts and their recent price target changes.\nEarnings Expectations: Nike is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings per share of 67 cents, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nThe company is expected to report fourth-quarter revenue of $12.59 billion.\nNike reported earnings per share of 99 cents and revenue of $12.23 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.\nThe company has beat earnings per share expectations for the last 11 straight quarters, with the most recent figure being 79 cents in the third quarter.\nNike has beaten revenue estimates in the last six straight quarters and nine out of the last 11. The company reported $12.39 billion in revenue in the third quarter.\nRelated Link: Nike, Fortnite Collaboration Airphoria Bridges Physical And Digital Realms\nWhat Analysts Are Saying: Morgan Stanley analyst Alex Straton recently reiterated an Overweight rating and a price target of $130 for Nike.\nThe analyst says the company is set up to beat a lowered bar for the fourth quarter. With revenue growth in line with past years, the analyst thinks Nike could report 75 cents in earnings per share, beating Street estimates.\nThe worry for the analyst and the Street is related to the demand for sportswear, which could increase inventory and the outlook for the company going forward.\nConcern over China's growth is also listed by the analyst as a potential issue.\nSeveral analysts have lowered their price targets on Nike stock going into the fourth quarter earnings report.\nJP Morgan analyst Matthew Korn lowered the price target from $152 to $146.\nDeutsche Bank analyst Gabriella Carbone lowered the price target from $133 to $126.\nWedbush analyst Tom Nikic lowered the price target from $139 to $129.\nAnother challenge for Nike could be the first-quarter financial results reported by leading footwear retailer Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) in May.\nFoot Locker reported first-quarter\u00a0revenue that was down 11.4% year-over-year and missed Street estimates. The company also said comparable same-store sales were down 9.1% year-over-year in the first quarter.\nThe footwear company also lowered its full-year sales guidance after the first quarter.\nWhile footwear is only one of Nike\u2019s business lines, the weakened demand from a leading retailer and seller of Nike products could signal some weakness.\nNKE Price Action: Nike shares are up 1% to $113.56 on Thursday, versus a 52-week trading range of $82.22 to $131.31. Nike shares are down around 5% year-to-date in 2023.\nRead Next: Analyst Ratings For Nike\u00a0\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n",

Bill Rabon,\u00a0North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly's\u00a0chief advocate for legalizing medical marijuana,\u00a0revealed publicly on Tuesday that he consumed cannabis over 20 years ago to withstand the pain and discomfort of chemotherapy during his struggle with cancer.\nSen. Rabon,\u00a0working on a measure to legalize medical marijuana (MMJ) for patients suffering from serious and terminal illnesses, describes himself as a colon cancer survivor.\n\u201cI\u2019ve told it many, many times privately, and I have no shame in saying, you know, \u2018this is what you will do in order to stay alive,\u2019\u201d Rabon told reporters after the committee\u00a0meeting where no\u00a0vote on the measure was taken, reported The Wilson Times.\u00a0\nCancer Diagnosis\nRabon, now 71, said he was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer at age 48. After surgery, Rabon\u2019s oncologist said he had 18 months to live. Rabon,\u00a0dissatisfied with chemotherapy after three months, recalled how the oncologist told him\u00a0a more aggressive form of treatment would make him \u201creal sick,\u201d and that\u00a0he needed \u201cto get some good marijuana.\"\nRabon said he didn\u2019t do drugs but was getting desperate. He decided to tell the local police chief and sheriff that \u201cI\u2019m going to have to buy drugs illegally to stay alive.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Weed Just Showed Up\nRabon never had to buy cannabis. He said it\u00a0would just\u00a0show up in his mailbox as needed.\nHaving access to medical marijuana\u00a0at home is \u201cthe only reason I\u2019m alive today,\u201d Rabon told the committee.\u00a0\n\u201cI know that tens of thousands of people in the state would benefit just as I did\u201d if the medical marijuana bill became law, he added.\u00a0The GOP-majority state Senate passed the bill on March 1 and it is pending in the House.\nIf approved, qualified patients with over a dozen conditions could qualify. Illnesses include\u00a0cancer, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and post-traumatic stress disorder as well as those with terminal illnesses or who are receiving hospice care.\u00a0\u00a0\nDemocratic Gov. Roy Cooper has already expressed interest in authorizing the bill if it reaches his desk.\nNumerous studies have\u00a0confirmed that medicinal marijuana is a safe and effective complementary treatment for pain relief in patients with cancer.\nPhoto of Rabon at the podium: The Fayetteville Observer Twitter\n\u00a0\n",

      "title": "Looking Into Baidu's Recent Short Interest",
      "body": "Baidu's (NASDAQ:BIDU) short percent of float has fallen 9.31% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 5.11 million shares sold short, which is 1.85% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 1.9 days to cover their short positions on average.\nWhy Short Interest Matters\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\nBaidu Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Baidu has declined since its last report.

      "body": "Investing in some asset classes has traditionally been limited by high barriers to entry, deterring many people from diversifying their holdings.\nBut fractional investments have emerged as a transformative trend across multiple sectors, including real estate investment trusts (REITs), exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and art. Fractional ownership offers investors the opportunity to own a fraction or share of an asset, eliminating the need for full ownership and enabling participation in previously inaccessible markets.\nSee Also: World's First Painting IPO For $55 Million Masterpiece Amidst Surging Art Market\nUnlocking Real Estate Opportunities\nFractional investment has revolutionized the real estate landscape, particularly through REITs. Investors can own a portion of a well-diversified portfolio of real estate assets, spanning residential, commercial or industrial properties. This allows individuals to enter the real estate market and potentially generate rental income without the burden of direct property ownership and management.\nMany REIT subsectors have witnessed earnings growth and increased analyst upgrades over the last quarter. The positive momentum is fueled by improved earnings prospects and a potential end to the current interest rate hike cycle. The upgrades could mean that these REITs have the potential to go up by over 20% from their current levels.\nDiversifying With ETFs\nETFs provide another avenue for fractional ownership, enabling investors to access a diversified portfolio of securities representing an index, sector or asset class. By buying and selling shares of ETFs on stock exchanges, individuals can gain exposure to a broad range of assets with lower costs and increased liquidity compared to traditional mutual funds. Fractional ownership of ETFs empowers investors with limited capital to diversify their portfolios and participate in various market segments.\nDemocratizing Art Investment\nFractional investment has extended its reach to the art world, challenging the notion that art investment is exclusive to the wealthy. Platforms like Masterworks have introduced the concept of purchasing fractional shares or fractions of valuable artworks. Art enthusiasts and investors can now diversify their holdings and potentially benefit from the appreciation of the art market without the need to acquire entire artworks. Fractional ownership in art opens doors for broader participation and democratizes the art investment landscape.\nRead Next: The Ultra-Wealthy Love This $579 Billion Recession-Proof Industry Outperforming The S&P 500\nNFTs And The Digital Art Revolution\nAnother significant development in fractional investments is the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their impact on the art market. NFTs provide a unique digital representation of artwork, creating a digital certificate of authenticity recorded on a blockchain. This technology has reshaped the traditional art market by enabling artists to sell their works directly to buyers through NFT marketplaces. This bypasses the traditional route of galleries and auction houses, offering artists more control and direct access to the market.\u00a0\nNFTs have introduced new revenue streams for artists through royalties on subsequent resales, ensuring ongoing benefits from their creations.\nExpanding Investment Horizons\nFractional investments have created opportunities for individuals to venture beyond traditional asset classes and unlock potential returns. By breaking down barriers of high capital requirements, fractional ownership allows investors with limited resources to participate in markets that were once reserved for the privileged few. This democratization of investment opportunities fosters financial inclusion and empowers individuals to shape their investment journeys according to their goals and preferences.\nNow Anyone Can Invest\nFrom real estate to ETFs and art, fractional ownership has opened doors for people with limited capital to diversify their portfolios and access markets that were previously out of reach. The advent of NFTs further expands the possibilities by revolutionizing the way digital art is bought and sold. As this trend continues to gain momentum, more investors can benefit from the potential returns and unique opportunities fractional investments offer, ultimately reshaping the way people engage with various asset classes.\n\u00a0",

      "body": "Although some claim Donald Trump was bad for art during his presidency, a different narrative emerges when examining his daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s art collection.\u00a0\u00a0\nAn article published on Time\u2019s website titled How Donald Trump\u2019s Presidency Shaped the Art World delved into the negative influence of Trump\u2019s policies and divisive rhetoric on artists and their creative expression. But Ivanka Trump demonstrates that she is not cut from the same cloth as her father when it comes to art.\nSee also: How One Artist Earned $738K In 32 Minutes\nJared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have curated an extraordinary contemporary art collection valued between $5 million and $25 million. While emphasizing that their art is primarily for personal enjoyment rather than investment purposes, their collection serves as a testament to their distinctive taste and appreciation for the arts. Renowned artists such as Alex Israel, Dan Colen, Nate Lowman, Alex Da Corte and David Ostrowski grace the walls of their collection.\nIvanka Trump\u2019s art collection not only adds to her carefully curated social media presence but also captivates art enthusiasts worldwide. But some artists have expressed dissatisfaction with being associated with the couple in the past, highlighting the complex relationship between art and politics.\nIn addition to their art collection, Kushner and Trump possess a diverse portfolio of assets, including properties, investments and other ventures, valued at approximately $811 million in 2021. Despite controversies surrounding their family name, their commitment to transparency is evident through the inclusion of their art assets in financial disclosures.\nInvesting in art goes beyond financial considerations, providing personal satisfaction, cultural enrichment and aesthetic enjoyment. Art investments also offer diversification benefits, introducing an alternative asset class that can potentially mitigate risk and enhance overall investment returns.\nMasterworks makes it possible for anyone, regardless of their wealth, to invest in fine art and enjoy the potential financial gains that come with it. Masterworks is an alternative investment platform that offers individual investors the opportunity to own shares of renowned works of art. Through this platform, investors can buy a portion of a valuable artwork instead of owning the entire piece. To ensure the safety and preservation of the artworks, they are stored in a secure and controlled environment with proper climate conditions.\nRead next: Jeff Bezos's $500 Million Superyacht Showcases Sculpture Resembling His Fianc\u00e9e on the Bow\nContemporary art has shown a strong appreciation in high inflation periods, which is particularly relevant in the current economic climate. As inflation erodes the purchasing power of traditional currencies, investors seek alternative assets that can act as a hedge against inflation and preserve their wealth. Contemporary art is a viable investment option, attracting attention from both seasoned collectors and new investors.\nOne of the reasons behind the appreciation of contemporary art in high inflation periods is its scarcity. Unlike stocks or bonds that can be easily replicated or created, original works of art are unique and limited in number. As a result, the demand for contemporary art tends to outpace its supply, driving up prices.",

      "body": "BlackBerry Ltd (NYSE:BB) was surging over 13% on Thursday after printing better-than-expected first-quarter earnings.\nThe company reported earnings of 6 cents per share on revenues of $373 million, beating analyst estimates for a loss of 5 cents per share on revenues of $160.35 million.\nThe results caused bullish traders to rush into the stock and drive BlackBerry up toward a heavy resistance level near $5.50, where it stalled on short-term time frames.\nThe move higher also caused BlackBerry to negate its current downtrend. A downtrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of lower lows and lower highs on the chart.\nThe lower lows indicate the bears are in control, while the intermittent lower highs indicate consolidation periods.\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\nThe BlackBerry Chart: BlackBerry negated its downtrend by rising above the most recent lower high, which was printed on June 16 at $5.18. Although the downtrend is no longer in play, BlackBerry will eventually have to retrace to print a higher low above $4.71 in order to confirm a new uptrend.\n\nOn Thursday, BlackBerry left a gap below between $5.10 and $5.21, which is likely to be filled at some point in the future. When BlackBerry eventually retraces, the stock may form a reversal candlestick at the lower range of the gap, which could provide a solid entry for bullish traders who aren\u2019t already in a position.\nIf BlackBerry closes the trading day near its high-of-day price, the stock will print a bullish kicker candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come again on Friday. The second most likely scenario is that the stock prints an inside bar pattern to consolidate Thursday\u2019s spike higher.\nBearish trades want to see BlackBerry eventually form a bearish reversal candlestick, such as a doji or shooting star candlestick, which could indicate the local top has formed, and a reversal is on the horizon.\nBlackBerry has resistance above at $6.19 and $6.83 and support below at $5.50 and $4.70.\n\n\nRead Next:\u00a0Why CorMedix Are Trading Lower By 22%; Here Are 20 Stocks Moving Premarket\nPhoto: Blackberry\n",

To tackle this problem, it is advisable to use a cotton swab to clean the metal pins deep inside the case, even if they appear clean at first glance.

General Mills's sales decreased to $5.03 billion, a 1.87% change since Q3. In Q3, General Mills earned $557.90 million, whereas sales reached $5.13 billion. \nWhat Is ROCE?\nEarnings data without context is not clear and can be difficult to base trading decisions on. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) helps to filter signal from noise by measuring yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q4, General Mills posted an ROCE of 0.06%.\nIt is important to keep in mind that ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but does not account for factors that could affect earnings and sales in the near future. \nROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows General Mills is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. \nFor General Mills, the positive return on capital employed ratio of 0.06% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively.  Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns.\nUpcoming Earnings Estimate\nGeneral Mills reported Q4 earnings per share at $1.12/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.07/share.\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.",

In Q3, National Beverage earned $34.36 million, and total sales reached $268.48 million. \nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed?\nReturn on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite.

Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) helps to filter signal from noise by measuring yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q4, American Outdoor Brands posted an ROCE of -0.02%.\nIt is important to keep in mind that ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but does not account for factors that could affect earnings and sales in the near future. \nROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows American Outdoor Brands is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. \nFor American Outdoor Brands, a negative ROCE ratio of -0.02% suggests that management may not be effectively allocating their capital. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns; poor capital allocation can be a leech on the performance of a company over time.\nUpcoming Earnings Estimate\nAmerican Outdoor Brands reported Q4 earnings per share at $0.06/share, which beat analyst predictions of $-0.13/share.\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.",

      "body": "An unprecedented venture has emerged on the American political scene, as Legalize America has been officially unveiled as the country's first Super Political Action Committee (Super PAC) focusing exclusively on cannabis reform. Supported by leading regulated cannabis companies in the United States, the independent expenditure organization is geared towards thrusting the issue of cannabis into the spotlight in the 2024 election and beyond.\nLegalize America's primary mission is to reform the existing cannabis laws across the United States, but the Super PAC's commitment extends beyond just legalizing the plant. Matt Harrell, the chair of Legalize America and a notable figure from Curaleaf (OTC:CURLF), said \"Legalize America is committed to ending cannabis prohibition and advancing expungement efforts and responsible use.\" The group's planned strategies include scorecards, endorsements and focused independent expenditure campaigns, all aiming to catalyze cannabis reform and lay the foundation for a prosperous and fair cannabis industry.\nThe call for cannabis reform is not a niche issue. As indicated by a recent Pew Research Center survey, a whopping 88% of Americans support the legalization of either medical or recreational cannabis use. Currently, 38 states and Washington DC have established medical cannabis programs, and adult use is legal in 23 states and DC.\nDespite these advancements, Congress' stance on the issue seems mired in yesteryear. Legalize America's objective is to accelerate the nation's shift towards cannabis reform. Pete Meachum, the secretary of Legalize America and a representative of the Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), said, \"We believe the 2024 presidential election will be a pivotal moment in the fight to end cannabis prohibition. We are laying the groundwork now to use advertising, grassroots engagement, voter outreach and events to keep cannabis front and center throughout the campaign.\"\nLegalize America plans to form alliances with renowned public figures and brands to raise funds that will push forward their reform agenda. The group is also considering collaborations with industry partners to enable customers at regulated cannabis dispensaries to directly support the campaign through \"round up\" donations.\nFor more about Legalize America, visit www.legalizeamerica.us.\nPhoto: S.Borisov and Incredible_movements on shutterstock\n",

      "title": "Why Cannabis Must Embrace Traditional Retail",
      "body": "Why does the cannabis industry need to embrace traditional retail practices? The answer lies in the potential benefits that can be reaped by adopting proven solutions from traditional retail marketing and supply chain management techniques.\nWhile the cannabis industry has its unique characteristics, integrating traditional approaches can bring about increased efficiency, improved customer experiences, and enhanced growth prospects.\nTraditional Retail Principles Streamline Cannabis Supply Chains\nIn the fast-evolving cannabis landscape, traditional retail practices offer valuable lessons that can empower the industry to thrive. Take, for instance, the concept of a linear flow in the supply chain. Traditional retail embraces this approach, ensuring a smooth journey from manufacturer to consumer.\nBy applying this model to the cannabis industry, businesses can streamline production, distribution, warehousing, and retailing processes, ensuring a clear direction for their products.\nLeveraging physical channels like trucks, warehouses, and physical storefronts, cannabis businesses can optimize the movement and storage of products, maximize accessibility, enhance their market presence, and streamline operations through the adoption of established distribution practices.\nHowever, the federal illegality of the cannabis industry presents unique challenges, making traditional retail marketing techniques less effective as mass marketing strategies through widespread channels like television, radio, newspapers, and billboards are impeded by legal restrictions, limiting their reach to a broad audience.\nThis is where digital marketing innovations step in.\nDigital Marketing\nThe past decade has witnessed remarkable transformations in digital marketing, and supply chain management, opening up invaluable opportunities for the cannabis industry.\nDigital marketing prioritizes personalization and targeted advertising, empowering cannabis retailers to tailor messages, recommend products based on preferences, and create personalized shopping experiences through data analytics and customer insights.\nMeanwhile, omnichannel retailing stands out as it seamlessly integrates online, mobile, and physical storage platforms, empowering customers to browse and purchase products across multiple channels while optimizing supply chains for enhanced integration.\nThe shift from mass marketing to individualized engagement not only enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty but also capitalizes on the trend of smartphones becoming an integral part of our lives.\nStrategic Partnerships\nInnovation extends beyond marketing into the realm of supply chain management.\nOn-demand delivery and fulfillment are essential for retail success, and cannabis retailers can meet customer expectations for speedy and convenient shipping by implementing innovative methods like same-day or next-day services, and strategic partnerships with third-party logistics providers, ultimately boosting customer satisfaction.\nData-Driven Supply Chain Management\nData-driven supply chain management has revolutionized retail operations. By leveraging predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, and real-time tracking systems, cannabis businesses can optimize their supply chains.\nAccurate demand forecasting, efficient inventory management, and streamlined logistics operations are just some of the advantages that arise from embracing data-driven decision-making.\nLearn more about cannabis supply chain management and marketing from the experts at the next Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference in Chicago on September 27-28, following a successful gathering in Miami last April. The conference will feature experts in cannabis marketing, supply chain, and logistics, and presents a unique opportunity to find strategic partners and solutions to streamline operations and drive profitability.\nRelated News\n\nFrom Amazon To Cannabis: How These Two Companies Are Redefining Supply Chains For Efficiency & Compliance\nAI-Powered Cannabis Retail Platform Raises $500K To Revolutionize Shopping Experience\nWhy Cannabis Customers Are Gravitating Toward Brick-And-Mortar Stores, Not E-Commerce\n\nPhoto by\u00a0Heidi Fin\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash.\u00a0\n",

Lilly's key products include Verzenio for cancer; Mounjaro, Jardiance, Trulicity, Humalog, and Humulin for diabetes; and Taltz and Olumiant for immunology.\nSigilon Therapeutics Inc is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The company is developing a new class of therapeutics and functional cures for patients with chronic diseases by providing stable and durable levels of therapeutic molecules to patients.\nHow An Acquisition Works\nAn acquisition is when one company, called the acquiring company, buys most or all of another company's, or target company's, shares to gain ownership. Buying more than 50% of a company's stock allows the the acquirer to make decisions without the approval of the company's shareholders.\nAn acquisition can potentially lead to a merger with the parent company, which makes it similar to a merger. This is why the two terms are commonly grouped together as mergers and acquisitions (M&A). However, in a merger, the leadership & operations of both companies usually change dramatically, while during an acquisition this is less likely to happen.\nMake sure to follow our mergers & acquisitions calendar to stay-up-to-date on the most recent M&A deals.\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.",

      "body": "In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court has declared that the affirmative action admission policies of Harvard and the University of North Carolina (UNC), which factored in a prospective student\u2019s race, are unconstitutional.\n This decision marks a significant setback to long-standing efforts to increase the enrollment of racial minorities at American universities, CNBC reports.\nThe Majority Opinion\nChief Justice John Roberts, joined by his five conservative colleagues, wrote the majority opinion. He stated that both Harvard\u2019s and UNC\u2019s affirmative action programs \u201cunavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.\u201d He added that such admissions programs have never been permitted and will not be allowed now, according to CNBC. The majority determined that the policies of the universities breached the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause of the Constitution.\nAlso Read: Trump\u2019s Niece Says Democrats Are Just As Guilty As Their GOP Counterparts When It Comes To This: \u2018An Obscenity Beyond Measure\u2019\nThe Dissenting Voices\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson labeled the ruling as \u201ctruly a tragedy for us all\u201d in her dissent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the decision, stating that it \u201crolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress.\u201d She argued that the majority\u2019s ruling effectively prohibits the limited use of race in college admissions to achieve critical benefits, thereby cementing a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in a racially segregated society.\nThe Cases\nThe ruling addressed two separate but related cases, one for Harvard and the other for UNC. In the Harvard case, the decision was a 6-2 vote, with Jackson abstaining due to her previous service on Harvard\u2019s Board of Overseers until early 2022. In the UNC case, the vote was 6-3, with Jackson, Sotomayor, and Justice Elena Kagan, the court\u2019s third liberal, dissenting.\nNow Read: Trump May \u2018Be Bad For Art\u2019 But Jared Kushner And Ivanka Trump Have A Collection Worth Up To $25 Million\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

      "title": "Why Cannabis Must Embrace Traditional Retail",
      "body": "Why does the cannabis industry need to embrace traditional retail practices? The answer lies in the potential benefits that can be reaped by adopting proven solutions from traditional retail marketing and supply chain management techniques.\nWhile the cannabis industry has its unique characteristics, integrating traditional approaches can bring about increased efficiency, improved customer experiences, and enhanced growth prospects.\nTraditional Retail Principles Streamline Cannabis Supply Chains\nIn the fast-evolving cannabis landscape, traditional retail practices offer valuable lessons that can empower the industry to thrive. Take, for instance, the concept of a linear flow in the supply chain. Traditional retail embraces this approach, ensuring a smooth journey from manufacturer to consumer.\nBy applying this model to the cannabis industry, businesses can streamline production, distribution, warehousing, and retailing processes, ensuring a clear direction for their products.\nLeveraging physical channels like trucks, warehouses, and physical storefronts, cannabis businesses can optimize the movement and storage of products, maximize accessibility, enhance their market presence, and streamline operations through the adoption of established distribution practices.\nHowever, the federal illegality of the cannabis industry presents unique challenges, making traditional retail marketing techniques less effective as mass marketing strategies through widespread channels like television, radio, newspapers, and billboards are impeded by legal restrictions, limiting their reach to a broad audience.\nThis is where digital marketing innovations step in.\nDigital Marketing\nThe past decade has witnessed remarkable transformations in digital marketing, and supply chain management, opening up invaluable opportunities for the cannabis industry.\nDigital marketing prioritizes personalization and targeted advertising, empowering cannabis retailers to tailor messages, recommend products based on preferences, and create personalized shopping experiences through data analytics and customer insights.\nMeanwhile, omnichannel retailing stands out as it seamlessly integrates online, mobile, and physical storage platforms, empowering customers to browse and purchase products across multiple channels while optimizing supply chains for enhanced integration.\nThe shift from mass marketing to individualized engagement not only enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty but also capitalizes on the trend of smartphones becoming an integral part of our lives.\nStrategic Partnerships\nInnovation extends beyond marketing into the realm of supply chain management.\nOn-demand delivery and fulfillment are essential for retail success, and cannabis retailers can meet customer expectations for speedy and convenient shipping by implementing innovative methods like same-day or next-day services, and strategic partnerships with third-party logistics providers, ultimately boosting customer satisfaction.\nData-Driven Supply Chain Management\nData-driven supply chain management has revolutionized retail operations. By leveraging predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, and real-time tracking systems, cannabis businesses can optimize their supply chains.\nAccurate demand forecasting, efficient inventory management, and streamlined logistics operations are just some of the advantages that arise from embracing data-driven decision-making.\nLearn more about cannabis supply chain management and marketing from the experts at the next Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference in Chicago on September 27-28, following a successful gathering in Miami last April. The conference will feature experts in cannabis marketing, supply chain, and logistics, and presents a unique opportunity to find strategic partners and solutions to streamline operations and drive profitability.\nRelated News\n\nFrom Amazon To Cannabis: How These Two Companies Are Redefining Supply Chains For Efficiency & Compliance\nAI-Powered Cannabis Retail Platform Raises $500K To Revolutionize Shopping Experience\nWhy Cannabis Customers Are Gravitating Toward Brick-And-Mortar Stores, Not E-Commerce\n\nPhoto by\u00a0Heidi Fin\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash.\u00a0\nDisclaimer:\u00a0This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n",

Each unit consists of one share of class A common stock and two common warrants each exercisable for one share of class A common stock at an exercise price of $1.05 per share.\nThe common warrants will be immediately exercisable and expire five years from the date of issuance. The pre-funded warrants and accompanying common warrants are identical to the units, except that each pre-funded warrant is immediately exercisable for one share of class A common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001, the purchase price for a pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrants is $1.0499 and the pre-funded warrants do not expire until exercised. Gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting the placement agent's fees and other offering expenses, are expected to be approximately $4 million.\nThe closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about July 3, 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. In connection with the offering, the company has entered into an agreement with existing investors of the company who participated in this offering to reduce the exercise price of outstanding warrants to purchase up to 1.7 million shares of common stock, in the aggregate, which were issued in the company's October 2022 public offering and the company's June 2022 registered direct offering from $9.00 per share and $50.00 per share, respectively, to $1.05 per share, effective upon the closing of this offering.

      "body": "In the current market session, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock price is at $2640.00, after a 0.99% decrease. However, over the past month, the company's stock went up by 3.53%, and in the past year, by 49.32%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. \n\nComparing Booking Holdings P/E Against Its Peers\nThe P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. \nCompared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 31.17 in the Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure industry, Booking Holdings Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 26.53. Shareholders might be inclined to think that  the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. \n\nIn conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. ",

      "body": "To quote the famous Yankee Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra, \u201cit\u2019s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.\u201d\u00a0\nMost people have heard the phrase \u201cit\u2019s time in the market, not timing the market that matters.\u201d In this blog post, LCM Capital Management will explain why we believe it is imperative for investors to stay \u201cin the market\u201d irrespective of recommendations or suggestions of an impending bear market or correction.\nIf 2023 has taught investors anything so far, it should be, avoid listening to the \u201cexperts\u201d and doomsayers. Timing the market is a fools\u2019 game and attempting to accurately predict tomorrow\u2019s weather let alone tomorrow\u2019s market direction consistently is impossible, especially over the long-term.\nThe markets always go up and always go down. The stock market has however historically demonstrated its resilience and ability to recover after such corrections as 2002, 2008 & 2022 just to name a few recent ones. Despite these short-term corrections, and they are just that, \u201cshort-term,\u201d the market tends to exhibit an upward bias over extended periods. By staying invested, especially in line with one\u2019s risk tolerance, investors can ride out temporary downturns and capitalize on the aforementioned historical upward bias of the market over the long run.\nStudies have shown that attempting to time the market can lead to missed opportunities, as the market often experiences sudden and unpredictable shifts. Think March of 2020, the S&P 500 was down almost 30% through the first three months of the year as fears of Covid set in. It ended the year up over 16%. Rather than trying to outsmart the market, investors should focus on diversifying their portfolios and staying invested for the long-term.\nBy staying invested in the market, this allows investors to reap the benefits of both dividends and compound interest. Dividends provide a regular income stream regardless of market conditions. Over time, reinvesting those dividends can significantly enhance investment returns. Additionally, compound interest amplifies returns by reinvesting earnings back into your investments, leading to exponential growth over time. By staying invested, investors harness the power of compounding and maximize their wealth accumulation potential. \u00a0Case in point, the historical average yearly return of the S&P 500 over the last 20 years as of the end of April 2023 is 10.05% (7.335% when adjusted for inflation). This assumes dividends are reinvested.\nIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9 but investing in the stock market is a marathon and not a sprint. It requires resilience, patience, and a long-term perspective. While news of an impending bull or bear market can generate apprehension or overexuberance and wonderful news headlines, investors should not be swayed by the short-term predictions of analyst or strategist. Remember, every transaction whether it\u2019s in the stock market or art market needs a buyer and a seller. The problem is, both parties think they are right. I am often reminded of the famed deceased market strategist Joe Battapaglia who once answered the following to his prediction that the NASDAQ would rise 55% in year when it actually dropped 21%. \u201clike in baseball, if you hit .350 or .500, you\u2019re doing pretty well.\u201d I have yet to find a single investor who would like to live by that investing mantra.\nStay the course, stay invested and benefit from the market's historical resilience.

      "body": "Looking into the current session, BioNTech Inc. (NASDAQ:BNTX) shares are trading at $107.16, after a 0.24% spike. Moreover, over the past month, the stock spiked by 2.91%, but in the past year, decreased by 31.97%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. \n\nComparing BioNTech P/E Against Its Peers\nThe P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. \nCompared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 50.29 in the Biotechnology industry, BioNTech Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 3.81. Shareholders might be inclined to think that  the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. \n\nIn conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. ",

      "body": "In the Fed\u2019s 2023 stress tests, all 23 large U.S. banks demonstrated that they have sufficient capital to absorb hypothetical losses of $540 billion in the severely adverse scenario. \nThe news brought optimism to the banking sector, with bank stocks represented by the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) rallying 1.4% on Thursday. Goldman Sachs Inc. (NYSE:GS) and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) led gains, rising 3.5% and 3.3%, respectively.\nHowever, when looking at the Fed\u2019s 2023 stress test, the devil is in the details as certain shocks may not prove fatal for the bank, but they can still lead to substantial losses within its portfolio.\nWhich US Banks Are Most Vulnerable To A Collapse in Commercial Real Estate Market?\nFed Chair Jerome Powell recently stated that commercial real estate (CRE) loans were mostly concentrated in small and medium-sized U.S. banks, and that large banks have a lower exposure to the risk. \nGiven the notable shifts in demand for offices and downtown retail, largely influenced by the pandemic and the rise of remote work, CRE loans have become a focal point of scrutiny in the 2023\u2019s stress tests.\nIn a severely adverse scenario, the CRE market prices are expected to drop by 40% with large banks facing a substantial loss of $64.9 billion on their CRE exposures, equivalent to 8.8% of average balances.\nAmong the most vulnerable large banks to a CRE collapse are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Citizens Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:CFG), Northern Trust Corp. (NASDAQ:NTRS) and Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB). \nBankProjected loan losses on CRE % of average loan balanceProjected loan losses on CRE $ billionGoldman Sachs161.8Morgan Stanley13.72.0Citizens12.44.0Northern Trust11.50.7DB USA11.20.4RBC USA10.32.2\nAlso Read: Jobless Claims Fall More Than Predicted, GDP Soars 2% in Q1: Dollar Rebounds As Powell Sticks To Hawkish Tone\nBond Paper Losses Are An Even Hotter Potato For U.S. Banks\nBank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) is facing the consequences of a decision made three years ago to invest the majority of its $670 billion of pandemic-era deposit inflows into debt markets when bond prices were high and yields were low. \nAs a result, BofA ended the first quarter of the year with over $100 billion in paper losses, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, surpassing its largest peers in unrealized bond market losses.\nUnrealized fixed income losses may cause banks\u2019 margins to shrink, as holding onto these low-yielding investments may limit the bank\u2019s income potential from customer deposits. The repercussions of these decisions are evident in the recent underperformance of Bank of America\u2019s stock compared to its primary competitors.\nChart: Bank of America Has Underperformed Peers In 2023\n\nNow Read: Tesla Nearly Sells Out Inventory In This Country As Monumental Q2 Looks More Inevitable\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

Hyundai Motor Company (OTC:HYMTF) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA)\u00a0have said they are considering following their footseps, but the Swedish automaker\u00a0is the first European EV maker to formally commit to the NACS charging standard for its EVs sold in North America. These deals could give Elon Musk control of the charging infrastructure and the EV game as a whole, considering that this is the critical barrier to global EV adoption.\nFocus On The Customer\nGeneral Motors CEO Mary Barra\u00a0described the advantages of the GM\u2019s decision to adopt Tesla\u2019s NACS as its customers will gain access to 13,000 most efficient chargers in the US. This decision will also help GM save $400 million.\nWith EVs of above four automakers integrating Tesla\u2019s NACS as of 2025, it is official that the efforts\u00a0by the Biden administration to make the Combined Charging System (CCS) the dominant charging standard in the United States have failed, although Tesla\u2019s technology is yet to be approved as a standard by SAE International. Upon the news on Tuesday afternoon, Tesla shares rose 3%. A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a federally funded research center, reported that\u00a0the U.S will be installing 1.2 million public EV chargers by the end of the decade, without providing a breakdown of NACs and CCSs. The White House has confirmed that EV charging stations that use Tesla-standard plugs will be eligible for federal subsidies that translate to a financial support worth billions of dollars.\nThe Charging Wars Win Also Comes With Risks For Tesla\nBy opening its charging network, Tesla became eligible for federal subsidies.

Musk has promised that GM, Ford, Rivian and Volvo customers will be treated like a Tesla customer and Tesla customers might not like that. Moreover, the reason why Tesla did so well is because it designed the whole system including the EV, the software that runs it and the charging hardware that powers it. Therefore, once other automakers like GM and Ford join its network, Tesla will no longer have absolute control. According to the Energy Department, Tesla has 19,700 charging ports across the United States located at about 1,800 stations but only 12,000 Tesla chargers will be open to Ford, GM, Rivian and now Volvo vehicles. Meanwhile, there are 10,500 CCS ports located at 5,300 stations so cars designed to use these plugs will be condemned with less reliable and slower charging.\nAn Acknowledgment Of Tesla\u2019s Know-how\nThese agreements are a recognition of Tesla\u2019s know-how in terms of the charging infrastructure.

Are multi-billion dollar consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies, such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Nestle (OTCPK: NSRGF), or Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), poised to acquire struggling cannabis businesses, providing solutions to these challenges?\nChallenges Facing The Cannabis Industry\n\nRegulatory uncertainty in the cannabis industry creates barriers to entry, hampers interstate commerce, and hinders operational efficiency due to inconsistent regulations and licensing requirements.\nBanking and financial limitations arising from federal illegality restrict businesses' access to traditional banking services, leading to cash-based operations, security risks, and limited capital for growth and innovation.\nThe absence of industry-wide standards and testing protocols poses a challenge to ensuring consistent quality and safety across cannabis products, eroding consumer trust in the reliability of such products.\n\nAmazon, Nestl\u00e9, And Procter & Gamble?\nWith its experience in navigating complex regulations, supply chain management, and fulfillment capabilities, Amazon could acquire decaying cannabis companies and revolutionize the industry by optimizing operations, improving accessibility, and enhancing consumer trust.\nBy utilizing its existing resources and logistics expertise, Amazon could bring stability, innovation, and scalability to the industry, fostering its growth in a federally legalized environment.\nAs a leading CPG company, Nestl\u00e9's extensive portfolio and global presence make it an ideal candidate for acquiring struggling cannabis companies. Leveraging its expertise in product development, supply chain management, and regulatory compliance, Nestl\u00e9 could help streamline operations, enhance product quality, and establish industry-wide standards.\nWith a diverse range of household and personal care products, P&G could acquire decaying cannabis companies and apply their expertise in brand management, marketing, and product innovation to the cannabis industry. P&G's resources could support research and development efforts, while their established distribution channels could enhance market access.\nLearn more about strategic investment options, M&A, and the cannabis supply chain, from the experts at the next Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference in Chicago on September 27-28, following a successful gathering in Miami last April.

Strong brand recognition and consistent performance also cemented the Model Y's reputation as a reliable and valuable EV.\nAlso Read:\u00a0Tesla Nearly Sells Out Inventory In This Country As Monumental Q2 Looks More Inevitable\nAmong its competitors were the Skoda Enyaq, Audi Q4 e-Tron Sportback, Volvo EX90, and Volkswagen ID.4, all of which demonstrated commendable residual value performance. However, according to Christof Engelskirchen, chief economist at Autovista Group, the Tesla Model Y emerged as the standout. \"This Award confirms our internal data and what our partners across Europe are telling us: Model Y is a safe investment,\" a Tesla spokesperson told Autovista24.\nTesla credits the Model Y's robust value retention to its innovative product development, including over-the-air updates that provide customers with new and improved features. Durability also plays a significant role in the EV's success, with Tesla batteries losing just 12% of their original capacity after approximately 320,000\u00a0km (200,000 miles) on average.\nAnalysts from Autovista Group based their award decision on used-car market data from February to April 2023. The Model Y's residual value performance was particularly notable in France, Italy, Portugal, and Hungary. Jose Pontes, data director at EV-volumes.com, described the Tesla Model Y as the \"default choice\" in its segment, praising its efficiency, range, and dependability.\nNow Read:\u00a0Lucid's Future Shaky, 2 More EV Makers At Risk of Bankruptcy, Warns Analyst After Lordstown's Fall\nPhoto courtesy of Tesla\n",

      "body": "\nMcDonald's stock has been steadily rising and is battling the psychological resistance level of $300 per share, failing at this level twice now.\nIf the stock successfully breaches the $300 resistance, it could herald a new long-term upward trend for McDonald's.\n\nMcDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), a globally recognized fast food brand with its iconic golden arches and enticing menu, is once again making headlines.\nThis time, it's all thanks to a limited-edition berry-flavored milkshake known as the Grimace Shake.\nIn a surprising burst of creativity, McDonald's introduced the Grimace Shake to celebrate the birthday of their beloved mascot, Grimace.\nNot only did this delicious concoction delight taste buds, but it also caused a frenzy on TikTok. Users enthusiastically shared their experiences, generating a wave of excitement and transforming the product launch into an organic, viral marketing campaign.\nThis truly showcases the power of user-generated content and the influential role of social media in modern-day marketing.\nWith all this publicity for the brand, McDonald's stock has been consistently rising and is currently contending with the significant resistance level of $300.\nSince the beginning of this year, the price of McDonald's shares has increased by 13%. It came close to reaching $300 in May 2023, missing it by just two dollars.\nHowever, during this time, the stock experienced a slight decline, dropping by 6.25% and finding support at the $281 level formed from the high of November 2022.\n\nDespite a slight setback, the price momentum remained strong. Then it made a second attempt to reach $300, falling just short by three dollars.\nCurrently, the 20 and 50 simple moving averages are acting as reliable support for the stock. This could potentially drive the stock towards, and even beyond, the $300 resistance.\nIf this milestone is broken, it could signal the start of another long-term upward trend for McDonald's.\nAfter the closing bell on Wednesday, June 28, the stock closed at $291.74, trading up by 0.15%.\n",

      "body": "Marriott Intl's (NASDAQ:MAR) short percent of float has risen 5.06% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 5.75 million shares sold short, which is 2.49% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 3.3 days to cover their short positions on average.\nWhy Short Interest Matters\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\nMarriott Intl Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Marriott Intl has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.\nComparing Marriott Intl's Short Interest Against Its Peers\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, Marriott Intl's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 8.45%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock?

      "title": "The Best-Performing REITs Of The First Half Of 2023",
      "body": "As the first half of 2023 comes to an end, it\u2019s been a clearly challenging time for stocks, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) in particular, with Federal Reserve rate hikes and hints of recession to come. More than half of all REITs have had negative total returns so far.\nBut some REITs have done quite well as earnings have improved or analysts have raised their positions. Acquisitions have played a part as well in some of the best performances. Take a look at the best REITs over the first half of 2023. Although the top two are mortgage REITs (mREITs), the rest are spread across a broad base of subsectors:\nAngel Oak Mortgage REIT Inc. (NYSE:AOMR) is an Atlanta-based mREIT that specializes in offering wholesale nonqualified mortgage loans for borrowers who don\u2019t fit traditional lending guidelines.\nFollowing a terrible 2022 in which Angel Oak Mortgage had a total return (including dividends) of negative 61.9%, Angel Oak turned it around to lead all REITs so far in 2023 with a 64.35% total return. About two-thirds of that return occurred in January when mREITs and other financial services companies bounced higher from extremely oversold levels.\nAngel Oak\u2019s performance has been surprising, considering its first-quarter earnings of negative $0.37 was $0.57 below analysts\u2019 expectations and far below its first-quarter 2022 results. This was also the second consecutive quarter of 2023 in which Angel Oak missed the estimates.\nDespite this, analysts have been looking for a rebound in mREITs. On May 8, Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti maintained his Overweight position on Angel Oak and raised the price target from $8 to $9.\nAnother boost for Angel Oak shares came in early April when it announced the appointment of Manmohan \u201cManu\u201d Singh as group chief financial officer, succeeding Tracy Jackson, who retired after 12 years with Angel Oak Mortgage REIT.\nArlington Asset Investment Corp. (NYSE:AAIC) is a McLean, Virginia-based mREIT that focuses on investing in mortgage-related assets and residential real estate. It allocates capital between agency mortgage-backed securities, mortgage servicing right-related assets, credit investments and single-family residential properties.\nOn May 30, Arlington Asset Investment agreed to a merger with Ellington Financial Inc. (NYSE:EFC), which made Arlington\u2019s shares soar from $2.75 to $4.06 in one day. But Arlington has climbed another 11% since then.\nArlington Asset\u2019s total return is the second highest among REITs in 2023 at 53.2%.\nLife Storage Inc. (NYSE:LSI) is a Buffalo, New York-based self-storage REIT with 1,200 facilities encompassing 68 million square feet across 37 states and Washington, D.C.\nAfter turning down an offer to be acquired by Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) in February, Life Storage agreed to a superior offer from Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) in early April.\nIn May, Life Storage reported quarterly funds from operations (FFO) that were 6.94% higher than FFO in the first quarter of 2022 and revenue that beat the first-quarter 2022 number by 17.18%.\nLife Storage has a total 2023 return of 38.75%.\nEPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) is a Kansas City, Missouri-based diversified experiential REIT that owns and operates 363 movie theater chains, amusement parks, ski resorts, fitness centers and other recreational venues across 44 states.\nMany pundits wrote off EPR Properties this year, saying there was too much risk of default among its movie theater chains for it to prosper. But so far, EPR Properties has proven them wrong. In late April, first-quarter FFO of $1.26 per share and revenue of $171.4 million were both well above analysts\u2019 expectations. Finally, in June, EPR Properties received some positive recognition, when JMP Securities upgraded it from Market Perform to Market Outperform and Keybanc Capital Markets upgraded it from Sector Weight to Overweight.\nEPR Properties has a total year-to-date return of 29.32%.\nTanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc. (NYSE:SKT) is a Greensboro, North Carolina-based retail REIT that owns 37 indoor shopping centers and outdoor factory outlet malls with 14 million square feet and over 2,700 stores across 20 states and Canada.\nIn April, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers raised its quarterly dividend by 11.3% from $0.22 to $0.245 per share. Two weeks later, Tanger reported first-quarter FFO and revenue that beat the Street estimates and raised its guidance for full-year FFO.\nTanger has performed quite well in 2023 with a 243.07% return.\nWelltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL) is a healthcare REIT with 2,008 healthcare properties in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The properties are a mix of senior housing, medical offices and skilled nursing or post-acute care sectors.\nOn June 6, Welltower announced it was raising its 2023 Normalized FFO guidance from $3.39-$3.54 to $3.43-$3.56. Despite this, on June 23, Raymond James analyst Jonathan Hughes downgraded Welltower from Strong Buy to Outperform, yet raised his price target from $82 to $90.\nWelltower\u2019s total return so far in 2023 is 21.1%.\nPlymouth Industrial REIT Inc. (NYSE:PLYM) is a Boston-based industrial REIT that owns and operates 210 properties with over 34 million square feet in 13 East Coast and Midwestern markets. In 2023, Plymouth has outshined larger and more well-known industrial REITs such as Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) and Rexford Industrial Realty Inc. (NYSE:REXR) with some very positive developments.\nPlymouth Industrial\u2019s total occupancy at the end of 2022 was 99%, and its rent collection was 99.7%, both outstanding numbers. It\u2019s had some positive developments this year:\nIn February, Plymouth Industrial hiked its dividend from $0.22 to $0.225 per share. In April, Plymouth announced it was raising its first-quarter rental rates by 15.9%. In May, Plymouth reported FFO of $0.45 that beat estimates by a penny, while revenue of $49.4 million beat the Street view by $1.84 million and was 15.4% better than revenue of $43.81 million in the first quarter of 2022.\nOver the first half of the year, Plymouth Industrial REIT has had a total return of 21.03%.\nWeekly REIT Report:\u00a0REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it\u2019s too late.

(OTCPK:PVSP) is setting up Artizen Nano in Los Angeles, CA for expansion into the California cannabis market and to that extent has signed a letter of intent with MTN Group to enter into definitive agreements by end of July 2023.\nArtizen Nano will manufacture and distribute its Slurped nano beverages in the Los Angeles market as the second step of Artizen\u2019s Westcoast expansion. This is done in partnership with MTN Group, with whom the company has also signed a letter of intent to distribute the Slurped product line to its network of retailers. The Slurped brand is developing various additional collaborations with other brands.\n\u201cIn April we announced our entry into the Oregon recreational cannabis market and now we are completing our Westcoast expansion with our entry into California.\u201d stated German Burtscher, president and CEO of Pervasip. \u201cOur partnership with MTN Group will provide us with manufacturing capabilities in Los Angeles and access to retailers through its well-established distribution channels. We are excited to take Slurped to market and begin to collaborate with other brands. The nano drink market is one of the fastest growing segments in our industry and Slurped is a unique product that has matured over the past year and is ready for growth and entrance into the world\u2019s most exciting cannabis market.\u201d\nCanceling Acquisition And Partnership\nAdditionally, after careful evaluation and consideration of the evolving market dynamics and strategic priorities prior to the completion of its spin out of Artizen Corporation to Pervasip shareholders, the company is announcing the termination of a previously proposed acquisition and a separate partnership.\nThe terminated acquisition of BCCTG LLC and its brands and the termination of the partnership with KRTL Biotech for creation of its Korean Center of Excellence and Artizen Wellness line are part of the company\u2019s re-alignment efforts. Artizen\u2019s focus will center on high THC cannabis products, with a targeted regional focus on the US Westcoast and Northeast markets. In reaching these decisions, Pervasip\u2019s management team conducted a comprehensive analysis of various factors, including market conditions, financial projections, integration challenges, and overall strategic alignment.\nWhile the initial intent behind these transactions was to enhance the company's competitive position, it has become evident that alternative strategies and opportunities can better address the evolving needs of the company and its consumers.\nPhoto by Esteban L\u00f3pez on Unsplash \nRelated News\nPervasip To Enter Oregon Recreational Cannabis Market\n\u00a0\n",

      "body": "STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION (\"STRATTEC\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:STRT) today announced that it has entered into and subsequently completed the transactions contemplated by an Equity Restructuring Agreement (Restructuring Agreement) between the Company and WITTE Automotive GmbH (WITTE) related to both the Company's Vehicle Access Systems Technologies LLC (VAST LLC) joint venture and its STRATTEC Power Access LLC (SPA) joint venture. STRATTEC and WITTE closed on the transactions in the Restructuring Agreement effective as of June 30, 2023. Prior to the closing of the Restructuring Agreement, STRATTEC was a one-third owner of the VAST LLC joint venture with WITTE and ADAC Plastics, Inc. Under the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, STRATTEC agreed to sell to WITTE its one-third interest in VAST LLC for a net purchase price of\u00a0$18,500,000\u00a0(subject to adjustments for any required tax obligations, transaction expenses and fees incurred by the Company under the Restructuring Agreement) plus STRATTEC received ownership of: (1) WITTE's\u00a020%\u00a0minority interest in STRATTEC Power Access LLC (SPA), a Delaware limited liability company formed in the Company's 2009 fiscal year to supply the North American portion of the Power Sliding Doors, Liftgates, Tailgates, Deck Lids and other Access Control System products which were acquired from Delphi Corporation in 2009; and (2) the net assets of VAST LLC's Korea branch office, which business will be operated by a newly registered Korea branch of the Company, following the closing of the Restructuring Agreement.\n\u00a0\nFrank Krejci, President and CEO commented: \"After over two decades of a business Alliance and JV partnership with WITTE, we jointly came to the conclusion that the changing technology in the auto industry, changes in our respective product lines and shifts in global commerce necessitated a rethink of our business relationship. The primary result of this rethinking is the sale of our equity stake in VAST LLC and securing\u00a0100%\u00a0ownership of SPA.\nWhile the equity ownerships will change, we expect to continue to leverage the VAST brand and to collaborate on product development and manufacturing capabilities in winning new business and serving global customers. This Equity Restructuring Agreement will position STRATTEC to redeploy assets, both financial and technical, to create greater focus on STRATTEC-specific strategic growth opportunities in North America and around the world. We believe this transaction is a very positive step to allow us to be more focused and competitive in this exciting and once-in-a-lifetime restructuring of a major industry where we are well-positioned to take advantage of new opportunities. This includes more of our product applications on Electric Vehicles, growing consumer demand for Power Access products, expansion of electronics capabilities and other new automotive products. It will also give us greater resources to further explore diversification of markets, complimentary technology and regions outside of North America.\"",

      "body": "Investors are on the hunt for undervalued, underfollowed and emerging stocks, and retail traders have countless methods at their disposal to uncover new information.\nFor some, this may be overwhelming.\nBenzinga\u2019s Stock Whisper Index uses a combination of proprietary data and pattern recognition to showcase five stocks each week that are just under the surface and warrant attention.\nThe index layers editorial commentary to help make sense of why these stocks should be of interest and whether investors and casual readers should watch them.\nHere is a look at the Benzinga Stock Whisper Index for the week of June 29, 2023.\nJoby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY): The electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) company saw shares soar during the week after it received a Special Airworthiness Certificate. The certification will allow the company to begin flight testing for its production prototype. Joby expects the aircraft to be used for\u00a0logistics at\u00a0Edwards Air Force Base in 2024 as part of a $131 million contract with the U.S. Air Force.\n\u201cToday\u2019s achievement is the culmination of years of investment in our processes and technology and it marks a major step on our journey to scaled production,\u201d Joby CEO JoeBen Bevirt said.\nJoby announced a SPAC merger in 2021 to go public with investors in the company including Uber Technologies, Toyota Motor Corp, Baillie Gifford, Intel Corp and JetBlue Airways Corp. The company plans to launch its commercial passenger business line in 2025 with cities like Chicago, New York City, Dallas, Washington D.C., Miami, Los Angeles and San Francisco mentioned previously.\nRelated Link: What's Going On With Lilium, Archer Aviation, Vertical Aerospace Shares Wednesday\u00a0\nMinerva Neurosciences (NASDAQ:NERV): The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company saw shares rise\u00a0this\u00a0week after a $20 million investment from Boehringer Ingelheim and Federates Hermes Kaufmann Funds was announced. The private placement was priced at a premium to where shares were trading, sending them higher. The company will use the proceeds to support its efforts for regulatory approval and market launch of the schizophrenia symptom drug roluperidone.\nCarnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL): The cruise line operator reported second-quarter results Monday. Second quarter revenue of $4.91 billion beat a Street consensus estimate of $4.77 billion. The company\u2019s earnings per share also beat analysts\u2019 estimates for the quarter. Carnival said it was seeing strong booking demand, with CEO Josh Weinstein calling volumes \u201ctremendous.\u201d\nWhile Carnival shares sold off initially after the earnings report Monday, they hit new 52-week highs later in the week after seeing strong support from analysts. Several analysts raised their price targets on the stock after the earnings report, including Jefferies going from $9 to $25 and upgrading shares from Hold to Buy.\nTRxADE Health (NASDAQ:MEDS): The health services IT company finds its way into the Stock Whisper Index for a second straight week, seeing strong interest from readers. The company's shares have rocketed higher by around 200% year-to-date in 2023. The surge came after news of a reverse stock split created a float of less than 700,000 shares. The stock experienced several halts due to\u00a0volatility as traders identified it as a low-float security. Shares sold off this week after news of an acquisition of Superlatus, a food products and distribution company.

While the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are diligently investigating employees of US banks such as First Republic and Silicon Valley Bank for potential stock trading misconduct, it is disconcerting that the SEC and NASDAQ continue to permit Freedom Holdings ($FRHC) to trade freely. Moreover, the potential for CEO's undisclosed sale of stock for personal gain needs to be investigated Freedom Holdings' potential acquisition of a US brokerage firm in Maxim is perplexing, considering their failure to file a 10k, repeated missed extension deadlines, the departure of their auditor, and sanctions and suspensions by the PCAOB for negligent oversight. It begs the question of why our exchanges allow companies with such questionable practices to trade. This is a farce. Where are the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), SEC, and DOJ in addressing these issues? It appears perplexing that short sellers in the US are under investigation while companies like Freedom Holdings escape scrutiny. We need accountability and regulatory intervention to maintain the integrity of our financial markets",

      "body": "Marvell Tech's (NASDAQ:MRVL) short percent of float has fallen 23.76% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 22.43 million shares sold short, which is 3.08% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 1.5 days to cover their short positions on average.\nWhy Short Interest Matters\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\nMarvell Tech Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Marvell Tech has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.\nComparing Marvell Tech's Short Interest Against Its Peers\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, Marvell Tech's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.71%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.",

      "title": "Cineverse's Return On Capital Employed Overview",
      "body": "Cineverse (NASDAQ:CNVS) brought in sales totaling $12.55 million during Q4 according to data provided by Benzinga Pro. However, earnings decreased 161.21%, resulting in a loss of $3.07 million. In Q3, Cineverse earned $5.02 million, and total sales reached $27.88 million. \nWhy Is ROCE Significant?\nEarnings data without context is not clear and can be difficult to base trading decisions on. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) helps to filter signal from noise by measuring yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q4, Cineverse posted an ROCE of -0.08%.\nIt is important to keep in mind that ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but does not account for factors that could affect earnings and sales in the near future. \nROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Cineverse is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. \nFor Cineverse, a negative ROCE ratio of -0.08% suggests that management may not be effectively allocating their capital. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns; poor capital allocation can be a leech on the performance of a company over time.\nAnalyst Predictions\nCineverse reported Q4 earnings per share at $-0.35/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $0.0/share.\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.",

Container Store Group reached earnings of $4.17 million and sales of $252.24 million in Q3. \nWhat Is ROCE?\nReturn on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business.

The Cupertino-based technology giant saw its stock rise 1.3% to a new all-time high of $192, cementing its position as stock market leader.\nApple\u2019s outstanding performance has resulted in an approximately $500-billion lead over its closest competitor, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.\nThe iPhone maker maintains its status of the most-representative stock in the S&P 500 index, rising to a 7.7% weight in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).\nApple\u2019s stock has now gained about 53% so far this year, and if it manages to end trading on Friday at its current or higher level, it will mark the best-performing semester since January 2009.\nRead also: \u2018Apple Car is a matter of \u2018when, not if\u2019 claims analyst\u2019 \u2013 Appleinsider\nChart: Apple Hits All-Time Highs, Market Cap Hits $3 Trillion\n\nApple\u2019s Valuations Start To Look Stretched\nApple currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 30, which is significantly higher than its 10-year historical average of 18x. \nThis valuation indicator might trigger worries about the stock\u2019s current overvaluation, serving as a cautionary note to investors.\nApple\u2019s current share price is about 3% higher than the price target set by the median Wall Street analyst, indicating that market expectations have probably priced in a substantial amount of the company\u2019s future growth.\n\nNow Read: After Meta, Google Plans To Cut Off Canada From News\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated to reflect that Apple has previously reached a $3-trillion market cap. \nPhoto: Shutterstock",

      "title": "Legalizing Weed 'For The Money' Is Wrong, GOP Gov. Says: But Reform Is 'Inevitable'",
      "body": "Some seven months after the New Hampshire Senate approved the formation of a study commission to explore various models for adult-use marijuana legalization, the bill passed the New Hampshire legislature Thursday and is now heading to Governor\u00a0Chris Sununu.\n\nWhat Happened:\u00a0Last month, Sununu did a\u00a0surprising u-turn on marijuana, confirming after years of opposition that he would be open to signing legislation that allows the sale of marijuana products in state-run retail outlets.\nAccording to the governor, the legislation should contain provisions similar to those regulating the alcohol industry.\nInitially, the bill was to create a commission consisting of representatives from the Senate, House, law enforcement, the cannabis industry, medical professionals, and community organizations, to study the new state store proposition for marijuana.\nHowever, the legislation was amended last week adding a requirement for the commission to use its findings and draft a state-rung legalization measure that could be later considered in the second half of the two-year session in January,\u00a0reported\u00a0Marijuana Moment.\nIf Sununu signs the bill, the commission would have to provide a comprehensive report by December 2023.\nAvoiding Veto Override, Making Better Protections \nSununu recently told CNBC that he has proposed his own model of cannabis regulation.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a big believer in terms of legalizing recreational marijuana, but the legislature is there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by I think 1,000 miles by states who have done it. Not only would the bill pass to let it happen, it probably would pass with the ability to override my veto. Even though I might not like it, my responsibility is to set up a model that, long-term, is better than all the other states around us\u2014that has the protections.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm not signing any bill.

These data showed that continued treatment with apitegromab over the extended treatment period was associated with substantial and sustained improvement in motor function, as well as improvements in patient-reported outcome measures in patients with nonambulatory Types 2 and 3 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) receiving survival motor neuron (SMN)-targeted therapy. Detailed results were presented today by Thomas Crawford, M.D., of Johns Hopkins Medicine, and the lead principal investigator of the TOPAZ trial, during two podium presentations at the Cure SMA Research & Clinical Care Meeting in Orlando, Florida.\n\"These promising long-term data highlight the therapeutic potential of muscle-targeted therapies, such as apitegromab, to help those with SMA address persistent weakness,\" said Dr. Crawford. \"While SMN-targeted therapies play an important role in preventing further loss of motor neurons, many people still experience persistent or progressive symptoms due to preexisting motor neuron degeneration. Incorporating a muscle-targeted therapy with apitegromab's clinical profile into the treatment paradigm could allow patients to sustain or potentially achieve new gains in motor functioning.\"\n\"We are excited to share these new Phase 2 data that support apitegromab's long-term durability of effect and consistent tolerability and safety profile. The results further strengthen our confidence in apitegromab's therapeutic potential for patients with SMA, as well as validate Scholar Rock's unique approach to selectively inhibiting the pro and latent forms of myostatin,\" said Jay Backstrom, M.D., MPH, President and Chief Executive Officer of Scholar Rock. \"In addition to the sustained benefit observed with consistent HFMSE scores, we saw continued improvement in RULM scores, and reductions in fatigue as reported by patients\u2014all of which can be important factors in performing activities of daily living. We remain committed to advancing the standard of care for people with SMA, and we look forward to sharing updates on our pivotal Phase 3 SAPPHIRE trial, which we anticipate will complete enrollment in the\u00a0third quarter\u00a0of 2023.\"",

      "body": "-\u00a0Improvements in patient-reported outcomes consistent with gains in motor function scores\n-\u00a0Safety profile at 36 months consistent with previous reports with no new safety findings; more than\u00a090 percent\u00a0of nonambulatory patients remained on study\n-\u00a0Enrollment progressing in pivotal Phase 3 SAPPHIRE registrational trial, anticipated completion in\u00a0Q3\u00a02023\n-\u00a0Scholar Rock to host virtual investor event on July 12 at 9:00 AM EST to discuss the current SMA treatment landscape and apitegromab's potential to advance the standard of care\nScholar Rock (NASDAQ:SRRK), a Phase 3, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of serious diseases in which protein growth factors play a fundamental role, today announced new data from the Phase 2 TOPAZ trial extension period evaluating patient outcomes at 36 months of treatment with apitegromab. These data showed that continued treatment with apitegromab over the extended treatment period was associated with substantial and sustained improvement in motor function, as well as improvements in patient-reported outcome measures in patients with nonambulatory Types 2 and 3 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) receiving survival motor neuron (SMN)-targeted therapy. Detailed results were presented today by Thomas Crawford, M.D., of Johns Hopkins Medicine, and the lead principal investigator of the TOPAZ trial, during two podium presentations at the Cure SMA Research & Clinical Care Meeting in Orlando, Florida.\n\"These promising long-term data highlight the therapeutic potential of muscle-targeted therapies, such as apitegromab, to help those with SMA address persistent weakness,\" said Dr. Crawford. \"While SMN-targeted therapies play an important role in preventing further loss of motor neurons, many people still experience persistent or progressive symptoms due to preexisting motor neuron degeneration. Incorporating a muscle-targeted therapy with apitegromab's clinical profile into the treatment paradigm could allow patients to sustain or potentially achieve new gains in motor functioning.\"\n\"We are excited to share these new Phase 2 data that support apitegromab's long-term durability of effect and consistent tolerability and safety profile. The results further strengthen our confidence in apitegromab's therapeutic potential for patients with SMA, as well as validate Scholar Rock's unique approach to selectively inhibiting the pro and latent forms of myostatin,\" said Jay Backstrom, M.D., MPH, President and Chief Executive Officer of Scholar Rock. \"In addition to the sustained benefit observed with consistent HFMSE scores, we saw continued improvement in RULM scores, and reductions in fatigue as reported by patients\u2014all of which can be important factors in performing activities of daily living. We remain committed to advancing the standard of care for people with SMA, and we look forward to sharing updates on our pivotal Phase 3 SAPPHIRE trial, which we anticipate will complete enrollment in the\u00a0third quarter\u00a0of 2023.\"\n",

Here\u2019s a look at some key analyst takeaways.\nWedbush On Nike\nAnalyst Tom Nikic maintained an Outperform rating while raising the price target from $121 to $139.\nNike reported mixed quarterly results and its first-quarter outlook was below expectations, Nikic said in a note. While demand in North America \u201cremains strong,\u201d recovery in China \u201cseems to be on track,\u201d he added.\nThe company made \u201csignificant inventory-cleanup progress,\u201d offering visibility into gross margin expansion, the analyst further stated.\nRBC Capital Markets On Nike\nAnalyst Piral Dadhania reiterated an Outperform rating while reducing the price target from $138 to $134.\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the 'health' of the Nike business exiting a challenging FY23, noting completion of inventory liquidation slightly ahead of plan, Gr China double-digit 4Q23 growth, strong brand and product momentum and clear consumer led channel strategy,\u201d Dadhania wrote in a note.\n\u201cWhilst FY24E guidance is below sell-side expectations, we believe it is more in-line with buy-side expectations based on recent discussions,\u201d he added.\nCheck out other analyst stock ratings.\nTelsey Advisory Group On Nike\nAnalyst Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez reaffirmed an Outperform rating and price target of $135.\nNike reported its fiscal fourth-quarter sales ahead of expectations, driven by the performance in China, Fern\u00e1ndez said.\nThe full-year guidance was mixed, but showed that \u201cthe company is beginning to lap higher freight costs and markdown activity,\u201d the analyst stated. \u201cThese benefits should continue in FY25,\u201d she added.\nKeyBanc Capital Markets On Nike\nAnalyst Noah Zatzkin maintained a Sector Weight rating on the stock.\n\u201cNKE posted strong 4Q top-line results across channels and geographies,\u201d Zatzkin wrote. The company\u2019s inventory position \u201ccontinues to improve,\u201d he added.\nThe analyst stated, however, that the guidance \u201cpoints to a considerable sequential y/y top-line slowdown in 1Q relative to growth in 2023.\u201d\nNKE Price Action: Shares of Nike had declined by 2.40% to $110.65\u00a0at the time of publication\u00a0Friday.\nRead Next:\u00a0Benzinga's 'Stock Whisper' Index: 5 Stocks Investors Are Secretly Monitoring But Not Talking About Yet\nPhoto: Unsplash\n",

New permits are up and when this pipeline of supply hits the market, it will put downward pressure on rents. This is important because housing is sticky inflation and is almost a third of total inflation,\u201d Bolvin said.\nJamie Cox, Managing Partner for Harris Financial Group, viewed the PCE data as good news on the inflation front, saying that if the Fed holds firm at current levels, it will prevent overcorrection and avoid causing an unnecessary recession.\n\u201cThis is excellent news on the inflation fight. If you don't believe disinflation is happening, you aren't paying attention,\u201d Cox said.\nThe economist\u2019s viewpoints underscore the market\u2019s cautious optimism in the face of slightly cooler inflation.Read next: Apple Breaks $3 Trillion Market Cap, Sets New Record High: Can The iPhone Maker\u2019s Stock Keep Climbing?\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

This is important because housing is sticky inflation and is almost a third of total inflation,\u201d Bolvin said.\nJamie Cox, Managing Partner for Harris Financial Group, viewed the PCE data as good news on the inflation front, saying that if the Fed holds firm at current levels, it will prevent overcorrection and avoid causing an unnecessary recession.\n\u201cThis is excellent news on the inflation fight. If you don't believe disinflation is happening, you aren't paying attention,\u201d Cox said.\nThe economist\u2019s viewpoints underscore the market\u2019s cautious optimism in the face of slightly cooler inflation.Read next: Apple Breaks $3 Trillion Market Cap, Sets New Record High: Can The iPhone Maker\u2019s Stock Keep Climbing?\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

      "body": "Median Overall Survival of 20.9 Months for Patients Without Active Liver Metastases Surpasses the Recently Reported 12.9-Month Benchmark with Standard of Care in this Population\nImmuno-oncology leader, Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN), shared promising data today from its Phase 1b trial on the botensilimab and balstilimab combination at a late-breaking session at the 2023 ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer (ESMO GI). The new data show substantial survival benefits and long-lasting responses for patients with non-MSI-H (microsatellite stable or non-microsatellite instability-high) metastatic colorectal cancer previously resistant to chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy.\n\"The data from our expanded cohort demonstrate remarkable median overall survival and sustained responses in heavily pre-treated patients that historically haven't responded to immunotherapy. These findings provide evidence of the benefit of botensilimab/balstilimab in metastatic colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S.,\" said Dr. Steven O'Day, Chief Medical Officer at Agenus. \"Our clinical research has shown confirmed responses in 8 other refractory tumor types, indicating the potential to transform clinical practice and patient outcomes for multiple challenging cancers.\"\nDr. Andrea Bullock, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and study investigator, commented, \"The new survival data underscore the potential of the botensilimab/balstilimab combination as an important treatment option for patients with non-MSI-H colorectal cancer. The patients in our study face one of the most challenging cancers to treat and represent the largest patient population with colorectal cancer where only a quarter of patients survive beyond one year with standard of care therapy. Botensilimab plus balstilimab continues to show deep and durable responses with\u00a069%\u00a0of objective responses still ongoing at the data cutoff.\"\nAgenus is planning to submit its first Biologics License Application to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with non-MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer. The ongoing global randomized phase 2 trial for patients with non-active liver metastases has been granted Fast Track Designation from the FDA. Additionally, global randomized Phase 2 trials for the botensilimab/balstilimab combination in melanoma and botensilimab/chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer are underway, with plans to initiate Phase 3 studies in colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nStudy Design:\nThe study enrolled 101 patients with refractory non-MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer who were administered botensilimab (either 1 or 2 mg/kg every six weeks) and balstilimab (3 mg/kg every two weeks).\nThe patients had a median of four prior therapy lines, with\u00a025%\u00a0having failed previous immunotherapy.\nEfficacy was evaluated in 87 patients who had undergone at least one six-week post-baseline imaging scan. Of these, 69 patients had no active liver metastases, defined as patients with no history of liver metastases or those with metastases that were treated or ablated without recurrence.\nHalf of the patients treated had poor-prognostic metastatic sites beyond the liver, such as bone and soft tissue.\nSurvival:\nPatients without active liver metastases had a 12-month overall survival (OS) estimate of\u00a074%\u00a0and a median overall survival (mOS) of 20.9 months, surpassing the recently reported 12.9-month benchmark with standard of care.\nPatients with active liver metastases had a 12-month OS estimate of\u00a030%\u00a0and a mOS of 8.7 months, surpassing the recently reported 5.9-month benchmark with standard of care. The botensilimab/balstilimab combination showed a survival benefit, regardless of RECIST 1.1 responses.\nmOS estimates for patients, categorized by liver status, were comparable between the efficacy evaluable and the intent-to-treat populations.\nObjective Responses:\nEvaluable patients without active liver metastases showed a confirmed objective response rate of\u00a023%\u00a0and a disease control rate of\u00a080%, significantly higher than the reported response rate of\u00a03%\u00a0with standard of care.\nThe responses were durable, with\u00a069%\u00a0of objective responses ongoing at data cutoff. Response durations ranged from 1.4+ months in recently treated patients to over 24.3+ months.\nTolerability:\nThe botensilimab/balstilimab combination demonstrated a manageable safety profile, with no new safety concerns emerging.\nPresentation Details:\nAbstract Title:\u00a0Results from an expanded phase 1 trial of botensilimab, a multifunctional anti-CTLA-4, plus balstilimab (anti-PD-1) for metastatic heavily pretreated microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (NCT03860272)\nAbstract Number:\u00a0LBA-4\nPresenting Author:\u00a0Andrea J.

      "body": "Burning Man CEO Marian Goddell attended\u00a0Psychedelic Science 2023\u00a0in Denver, where she spoke with MAPS strategic initiatives officer Liana Gillooly at one of the many packed lectures.\nPeople from all walks of life end up at Burning Man, Goddell says, citing Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0TSLA)\u00a0CEO Elon Musk among those who have attended.\nInclusivity is crucial, though it isn\u2019t always an easy task, she added.\nSee Also: Elon Musk Calls Banning Drugs A Net Societal Negative Just Like Dumb Alcohol Prohibition\n\u201cYou know, human flourishing means everybody,\" Goddell said. \"Healing potential is everybody... we\u2019re all here for the love and the connection, and to have a better life.\u201d\nBurning Man, or BM, takes place in Black Rock City (BRC) \u2014 a \u201ctemporary\u201d city built in the Black Rock Desert close to Reno, Nevada. The event attracts some 80,000 people regularly.\nGoddell is certain that she can\u2019t help change the world and bring about human flourishing by just trying to bring people to BRC.\nFurther, she said: \u201cBM is 80 events around the world, and it\u2019s happening in 35 different countries. And I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d\nShe believes this is happening because there is a real desire to help create difference in the world, human potential, social change, and just taking the opportunity to listen and breathe and frankly listen to all sides of it, and not solely endorsing the use of psychedelics.\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t think the answers for the human race are as simple as we believe, when we believe that we\u2019re really involved and we think that we see,\u201d Goddell told Gillooly. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much by listening. And I\u2019ve learned so much about what I didn\u2019t know about psychedelics,\u201d she added.\nBurning Man\u2019s Role In The Psychedelics Renaissance\nGoddell believes the way BM culture actually helps people is by encouraging them to rethink themselves, something psychedelic research is \u201cclearly helping people to do,\u201d she says.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the journey. Although Rick (Doblin) has been doing this for 37 years, if you imagine a 100-year plan, we\u2019re only in the first part of it,\u201d Goddell said. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t rest in our laurels. I can feel that energy from heaven, and feel the same way about BM.\u201d\nAbout long-term survival as an organization, Goddell says questions on governance must rise. \u201cAm I the last CEO? Is it another format needed for our organization?,\u201d she said, adding that the way BRC is currently governed is through councils and departments, asking people \u201cto not make many rules, ask more questions, and include more people in the table.\u201d\nBut the problem for BM right now, she says, is where it is actually making change.\n\u201cI\u2019m more interested in how burners can go out in the world and their communities and discover how they can be part of the arts council, or become elected officials, or how to organize their neighborhood together,\u201d actions that then usually lead to revelations about how we actually really make change in society by acting together and having conversations together.\u00a0\nShe believes all of it is part of the conversation. \u201cI think you can attend BM once, and find ways in which to live your life more creatively, more connectedly, and you can do it in your everyday life. That\u2019s the way in which we\u2019re all gonna change the world, that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.\u201d\u00a0\nThat is, in her view, the power of the culture and of religions as well: to really try to lift people up and help them be better people.\u00a0\nIn this sense, Goddell says Psychedelic Science, MAPS, BM culture and many others are actually part of the same culture.\n\u201cI believe that human flourishing is now, the work that we need to do to change the world is now, and we\u2019re only going to do it by looking towards others, toward affiliation and not separation, and this is the culture, the culture of change, the culture of human, the culture of life, creativity, communication, connection,\" she said. \"We\u2019re in it.\"\nMore on the conference coming your way.

      "body": "One creative\u00a0entrepreneur more than doubled his income by quitting his full-time job as a web\u00a0developer\u00a0and starting a side hustle selling t-shirts on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). The best part is he only has to work\u00a0one hour each day.\u00a0\nPrinting Money: Ryan Hogue got the idea\u00a0to start a print-on-demand side hustle when he stumbled upon a Reddit post about how to make money online. By 2020, the\u00a0side business became\u00a0big enough\u00a0that Hogue gave up his\u00a0$85,000 salary to focus on it full-time. Now it brings in $14,600 each month on average, and he only spends an hour working each day, per a CNBC report.\nHogue outsources all of the printing, packaging and\u00a0shipping, so he doesn't have to mess with any of the physical work or manage inventory. He really just has to come up with print\u00a0ideas, and he\u00a0doesn't have a background in design.\nHe originally tried using\u00a0Adobe Inc's (NASDAQ:ADBE) Photoshop, but it wasn't very user-friendly with his lack of experience, he said. Instead, he started using online platforms that allowed him to download illustrations with commercial licenses, so he didn't have to\u00a0start\u00a0from scratch.\u00a0\nCheck This Out:\u00a04 Brain Hacks To Supercharge Your Success\nHe spends most of his time coming up with design ideas by doing keyword research or planning around pop culture and upcoming events.\u00a0\nAbout half of what he makes is driven by Amazon's merch on-demand platform. Amazon makes it easy for creators to upload their artwork and choose their product types before automatically generating product listings and\u00a0handling production, shipping and even customer service.\n\"I like this platform because you don\u2019t have to pay money upfront for inventory,\" Hogue said.\u00a0\nSellers on the platform make between 13% and 37% depending on the product and price, and Amazon takes the rest. Hogue\u00a0even expanded his offerings beyond t-shirts and sells sweatshirts and hats as well as accessories like mugs, phone cases and stickers.\u00a0\nAveraging a little less than $15,000 per month means Hogue ends up making more than $175,000 per year, which is more than double what he was making working 40 hours per week as a developer.\n\"I want people to know that they don\u2019t need a degree in graphic design to succeed in the print-on-demand business. They just need a little bit of creativity and a lot of drive,\" Hogue said.\nRead Next:\u00a0Creative 29-Year-Old Makes $22K A Month Working 'Less Than 2 Hours A Day'\nPhoto:\u00a0bark\u00a0from Flickr.\nThis story is part of a new series of features on the subject of success,\u00a0Benzinga Inspire.\nSome elements of this story were previously reported by Benzinga and it has been updated.\n",

      "title": "They're After My Lucky Dividends: How to Earn $500 A Month from General Mills Stock",
      "body": "Jerome Powell\u2019s Federal Reserve increasing the interest rates isn\u2019t just affecting the markets \u2014 they\u2019re reaching into our cereal bowls as well.\nWhat Happened: General Mills Inc (NYSE:GIS), the cereal giant behind brands like Cheerios and Lucky Charms, reported a dip in revenue this fiscal year, citing higher carrying costs of inventory and larger customers managing their balance sheets as key factors in their reduced performance.\nFiscal fourth quarter volumes dropped by 8% and 2% in the North America Retail and Pet divisions respectively, with full fiscal-year volumes declining by 6% and 2% in the same.\nInflation, coupled with decreasing volumes, caused General Mills\u2019 gross profit margins to suffer. Reported gross profit margins in the fiscal fourth quarter dropped 1.8% year-over-year to 34.4%. For the fiscal year, gross profit margins fell 1.1% from a year ago to 32.6%.\nDespite the dip, General Mills reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 sales growth of 3% year-on-year, clocking $5.03 billion, though the figure missed the Street consensus of $5.17 billion.\nWhile the figures might cause investors to hesitate, there is potential for gains in the form of dividends.\nGeneral Mills currently has a dividend yield of 3.08% \u2014 let's do some math.Read Also: How To Earn $500 A Month From ZIM Integrated Shipping Stock\nFor an investor looking to earn $500 per month (or $6,000 annually) from shares of General Mills, they\u2019d need to invest about $194,805.19, which translates to 2,539 shares.\nIf the aim was to generate a more modest amount of $100 a month, or $1,200 annually, the investment needed would be about $28,961, or 508 shares.\nHere's how we calculate it: $6,000 / 0.0308 = $194,805.19 ($500 per month, $6,000 annually); $1,200 / 0.0308 = $28,961 ($100 per month, $1,200 annually).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. If the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.Read Next: How To Earn $500 A Month From SPY Stock\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

      "body": " Jerome Powell\u2019s Federal Reserve increasing the interest rates isn\u2019t just affecting the markets \u2014 they\u2019re reaching into our cereal bowls as well.\nWhat Happened: General Mills Inc (NYSE:GIS), the cereal giant behind brands like Cheerios and Lucky Charms, reported a dip in revenue this fiscal year, citing higher carrying costs of inventory and larger customers managing their balance sheets as key factors in their reduced performance.\nFiscal fourth quarter volumes dropped by 8% and 2% in the North America Retail and Pet divisions respectively, with full fiscal-year volumes declining by 6% and 2% in the same.\nInflation, coupled with decreasing volumes, caused General Mills\u2019 gross profit margins to suffer. Reported gross profit margins in the fiscal fourth quarter dropped 1.8% year-over-year to 34.4%. For the fiscal year, gross profit margins fell 1.1% from a year ago to 32.6%.\nDespite the dip, General Mills reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 sales growth of 3% year-on-year, clocking $5.03 billion, though the figure missed the Street consensus of $5.17 billion.\nWhile the figures might cause investors to hesitate, there is potential for gains in the form of dividends.\nGeneral Mills currently has a dividend yield of 3.08% \u2014 let's do some math.Read Also: How To Earn $500 A Month From ZIM Integrated Shipping Stock\nFor an investor looking to earn $500 per month (or $6,000 annually) from shares of General Mills, they\u2019d need to invest about $194,805.19, which translates to 2,539 shares.\nIf the aim was to generate a more modest amount of $100 a month, or $1,200 annually, the investment needed would be about $28,961, or 508 shares.\nHere's how we calculate it: $6,000 / 0.0308 = $194,805.19 ($500 per month, $6,000 annually); $1,200 / 0.0308 = $28,961 ($100 per month, $1,200 annually).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. If the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.Read Next: How To Earn $500 A Month From SPY Stock\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

      "body": "The stock market rebounded in 2023 with top indexes trading higher after 2022, which saw market declines. Many top technology stocks are among the biggest leaders with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) carrying the S&P 500 higher.\nHere\u2019s a look at how the Dow Jones Industrial Average is performing at the halfway point of 2023.\nWhat Happened: Created in 1896 by Charles Dow, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the oldest and most followed equity indexes for overall stock market health. The Dow Industrial Average consists of 30 stocks on a price-weighted basis.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA), which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is up 3.6% year-to-date in 2023.\nShares of the ETF are trading near 52-week highs as the first half of 2023 ends. The move up comes after the Dow Jones Index was down 8.8% in 2022.\nLeading the Dow Jones are Salesforce Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CRM), Apple and Microsoft, which are each up 40% or more year-to-date.\nFor the first half of the year, the Dow Jones was split evenly with 15 stocks up and 15 down, based on closing prices on June 29.\nHere\u2019s a look at the stocks that are down in 2023 year-to-date.\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG): -1.4%\nHome Depot Inc\u00a0(NYSE:HD): -2.5%\nHoneywell International (NASDAQ:HON): -3.7%\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM): -4.8%\nCoca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO): -5.6%\nGoldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS): -5.9%\nVerizon Communications Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:VZ): -6.1%\nNike Inc (NYSE:NKE): -7.0%\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ): -7.1%\nTravelers Companies Inc (NYSE:TRV): -8.8%\nUnitedHealth Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:UNH): -10.1%\nChevron Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:CVX): -13.0%\nAmgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN): -15.8%\n3M Co (NYSE:MMM): -17.2%\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA): -24.1%\nRelated Link: Nike Q4 Earnings Highlights: Revenue Beat, EPS Miss, China Sales, Inventory Update And More\u00a0\nWhy It\u2019s Important: While several Dow Jones stocks are up double digits halfway through the year, half of them are down on the year with Walgreens having the biggest decline.\nMany of the stocks that are part of the Dow Jones are considered consumer staples and blue chip stocks, which\u00a0could indicate how healthy the economy is.\nInvestors should recognize that the market increase in 2023 is being led by technology names and there is increased attention to artificial intelligence stocks. Not all sectors are seeing strong performance in 2023 and could see declines again in the full year.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average has not posted two straight years of declines since 2001 and 2002. With the index up between 3% and 4%, there is still a possibility that the index posts back-to-back declines.\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index, is up 16.2% year-to-date and far outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average and tracking ETF. The S&P 500 was down over 19% in 2022, a worse decline than the Dow Jones, which may point to some of the bounce back in 2023.\nRead Next: 10 Highest Yielding Dow Jones Stocks\u00a0\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\u00a0\n",

(NASDAQ:FRHC), a financial services company.\nCitron Research\u00a0has criticized the company for its questionable IPO model, lack of oversight, and potential violation of sanctions, among other issues. In a tweet on Friday, the research firm called for regulatory intervention to maintain the integrity of the financial markets.\nFreedom Holdings didn't immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comment.\nQuestionable Business Practices\nCitron Research pointed to the company's potential acquisition of a U.S. brokerage firm, Maxim, and\u00a0questioned why exchanges allow companies with questionable practices to trade. As Citron Research tweeted, \"Freedom Holdings' potential acquisition of a US brokerage firm in Maxim is perplexing, considering their failure to file a 10k, repeated missed extension deadlines, the departure of their auditor, and sanctions and suspensions by the PCAOB for negligent oversight.\"\nAlso Read:\u00a0Trump, Inner Circle Could Face More Charges As DOJ Reportedly Prepares 'Superseding' Indictment\nRegulatory Concerns\nCitron has also raised concerns about the company's potential violation of sanctions and related party transactions.

Despite this, Turlov has continued to operate FFIN Brokerage Services, a corporation registered in Belize, which is not part of Freedom Holdings but is personally owned by Turlov, the report added.\nCitron Research expressed its concern in a tweet on Friday, stating, \"While the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are diligently investigating employees of US banks such as First Republic and Silicon Valley Bank for potential stock trading misconduct, it is disconcerting that the SEC and NASDAQ continue to permit Freedom Holdings ($FRHC) to trade freely.\"\nCall for Transparency\nCitron Research has called for Freedom Holdings to disclose any ongoing investigations by U.S. government agencies. The firm states that it finds it hard to believe that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Treasury, or Department of Justice (DOJ) have not initiated an investigation into the company. Citron maintains confidence in the regulatory system and suspects that Freedom Holdings might be withholding crucial information from its shareholders. As Citron Research tweeted, \"It is imperative for the company to promptly disclose any ongoing investigations by US government agencies.\"\nCitron Wants Investors To Be Protected\nGiven the numerous concerns surrounding Freedom Holdings, Citron Research has called for a thorough investigation into the company's practices. The firm hopes that the SEC and NASDAQ will take action to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the financial markets. \"We need accountability and regulatory intervention to maintain the integrity of our financial markets,\" Citron tweeted.\nNow Read:\u00a0How To Earn $500 A Month From SPY Stock\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n",

Treatment persistence rates were high, with\u00a082.3%\u00a0of patients remaining on treatment by month 12.\nNot only was fremanezumab effective in preventing migraine attacks in patients with chronic and episodic migraine, but it has also shown to be effective in reducing the severity and duration of remaining migraine attacks.\nFour abstracts from the third interim analysis of the PEARL study will be presented at the 9th\u00a0European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress in Budapest, Hungary. The primary analysis is being presented as an oral presentation by Professor Cristina Tassorelli, Department of Brain and Behavioural Sciences, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy on July 1, 2023.\nCommenting on the findings, Professor Tassorelli said: \"Preventive treatments are of the utmost importance for reducing the burden of severe migraine, but levels of use of preventive drugs across Europe are still low, resulting in sub-optimal patient care. These interim findings add to our growing evidence with fremanezumab in the real-world, showing how the burden of migraines can be reduced when an eligible patient has access to monoclonal antibodies like fremanezumab.\"\nPinar Kokturk, M.D. Vice President & Head of Medical Affairs Europe at Teva, said: \"The 3rd\u00a0interim analysis of the PEARL study provides valuable insights for clinicians and patients into the effectiveness of fremanezumab (AJOVY\u00ae) in a real-world setting. Real-world data allows us to bridge the gap between scientific evidence and the complexities of real-life scenarios, offering a comprehensive understanding of how treatments truly impact patients' lives. The PEARL study is particularly relevant to clinicians due to its large patient cohort, coming from 11 countries across Europe\".1\nEditors' Notes",

This analysis is being presented at the 9th\u00a0Congress of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN), July 1-4 in Budapest.\nUPLIZNA is the first and only targeted CD19+ B-cell-depleting therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Commission and the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) for the treatment of NMOSD in adults who are anti-aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G seropositive (AQP4-IgG+). The N-MOmentum pivotal trial (NCT02200770) is also the largest Phase 3 clinical trial in NMOSD and the only Phase 3 trial that collected MRI data, which were also incorporated into its attack adjudication criteria. Results from this post-hoc analysis demonstrate that UPLIZNA effectively reduced the formation of subclinical MRI lesions, while also showing an association between subclinical spinal cord lesions and future attacks.\n\"This analysis offers new insights into the significance of subclinical MRI findings on the spinal cord as a potential signal of future attacks, adding to the growing list of tools available for physicians to better monitor their patients,\" said Friedemann Paul, study author and Group Leader of the Clinical Neuroimmunology Department of NeuroCure Clinical Research Centre at the Charit\u00e9, Berlin. \"It is encouraging to see that UPLIZNA reduced the formation of these lesions. Future studies evaluating subclinical findings will help offer additional clarity on their relationship with disease activity.\"\nDuring the trial, MRI imaging was conducted on the spinal cord, optic nerve and brain/brainstem to quantify the frequency, prognosis and response to treatment with UPLIZNA of subclinical lesions. This was taken at the time of screening, at the end of the 28-week randomized controlled period (RCP), at the time of any attack and annually during the open-label portion (OLP) of the trial. Of the 134 pivotal trial participants with full neuroaxis MRI and no new NMOSD symptoms at the end of the 28-week RCP, 20 (15%) were found to have asymptomatic MRI lesions on the spinal cord. These lesions were shorter than attack-associated lesions, and importantly were less frequent among those receiving UPLIZNA.\nSubsequent MRI findings showed that the formation of these lesions decreased as treatment with UPLIZNA continued. Interestingly, these findings showed that subclinical lesions were associated with domain-specific attacks in the following year.\n\"Attack prevention is a priority in managing NMOSD, as just one attack can lead to life-altering vision loss and mobility challenges,\" said Kristina Patterson, M.D., Ph.D., senior medical director, neuroimmunology medical affairs, Horizon. \"We are pleased to see that the long-term Phase 3 pivotal trial data show that UPLIZNA effectively reduced subclinical MRI findings and NMOSD attacks while continuing to offer new learnings that help advance our understanding of the disease and improve patient care.\"\nAbout Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)\nNMOSD is a unifying term for neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and related syndromes. NMOSD is a rare, severe, relapsing, neuroinflammatory autoimmune disease that attacks the optic nerve, spinal cord, brain and brain stem.1,2\u00a0Approximately\u00a080%\u00a0of all patients with NMOSD test positive for anti-AQP4 antibodies.3\u00a0AQP4-IgG binds primarily to astrocytes in the central nervous system and triggers an escalating immune response that results in lesion formation and astrocyte death.4\nAnti-AQP4 autoantibodies are produced by plasmablasts and some plasma cells. These B-cell populations are central to NMOSD disease pathogenesis, and a large proportion of these cells express CD19.5\u00a0Depletion of these CD19+ B cells is thought to remove an important contributor to inflammation, lesion formation and astrocyte damage. Clinically, this damage presents as an NMOSD attack, which can involve the optic nerve, spinal cord and brain.4,6\u00a0Loss of vision, paralysis, loss of sensation, bladder and bowel dysfunction, nerve pain and respiratory failure can all be manifestations of the disease.7\u00a0Each NMOSD attack can lead to further cumulative damage and disability.8,9\u00a0NMOSD occurs more commonly in women and may be more common in individuals of African and Asian descent.10,11\nAbout UPLIZNA\nINDICATION\nUPLIZNA is indicated for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive.",

      "body": "As the weekend approaches, investors hold their breath for Tesla Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) April to June EV delivery report.\nWhile analysts predict a solid 448,000 vehicles, Friday's spotlight was stolen by Xpeng Inc \u2013 ADR (NYSE:XPEV). The Chinese automaker saw its shares rally over 12% after pricing its G6 SUV below Tesla's Model Y.\nXpeng\u2019s Strategic Pricing: Xpeng\u2019s move, pricing its latest G6 SUV at 209,900 yuan ($28,814), undercuts the starting price for Tesla\u2019s Model Y, which stands at 263,900 yuan ($40,992) in China.\nThe move is speculated to boost Xpeng's market share, potentially placing the G6 as one of the best-selling EVs in China.\nAnalysts view Xpeng\u2019s pricing strategy positively, according to Investor Place. Some predict it could spur the company to shift 100,000 units each month. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) noted the new price point will appeal to EV customers that can\u2019t afford the pricier Model Y or Xpeng's own P7i.\nTesla's Uphill Battle: Despite growing competition, Tesla remains in the lead, though it hasn't been smooth sailing. The company has been aggressively slashing prices across its model lineup to defend its market position against competitors such as Xpeng, which is trying to lure away customers with newer models.Read Also: Tesla Gigafactory Mexico Opening Reportedly Delayed To Early 2025 Amid Logistical Hurdles\nWhile Tesla\u2019s dominance remains unchallenged in the U.S., the company has been outperformed in China by BYD Company ADR (OTC:BYDDY), a company backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B).\nIn response to rising inflation and interest rates, Tesla began discounting late last year, initiating the trend in China before extending it to the U.S and Europe.\nQ2 Delivery Expectations \u2013 Tesla, NIO, And Xpeng: Looking ahead, second-quarter delivery reports are expected to bring more clarity to the EV landscape. While Tesla is expected to maintain its leading position with a predicted sales number around 448,350 cars, competition is stiff.\nXpeng delivered 18,230 cars in the first quarter, a decline of 47% year over year. Following the restructuring of its management, the company is now forecasting at most 22,000 vehicle deliveries in the second quarter. Meanwhile, NIO Inc \u2013 ADR (NYSE:NIO) expects to deliver 23,000 to 25,000 vehicles in the second quarter, a slight decrease from the previous year.\nThe Last Word: With Xpeng\u2019s latest pricing strategy and Tesla\u2019s aggressive moves to defend its market position, the EV market is heating up. Second-quarter delivery reports from major EV makers, including Tesla, NIO and Xpeng, will help set the tone for the rest of the year.\nRead Next: Volkswagen May Join Other Players \u2013 It\u2019s In Talks with Tesla to Adopt North American Charging Standard\nPhoto: Courtesy Xpeng",

[This way, we can] improve the mental and physical well-being of the victims of hostilities and their families.\u201d\n\n\nSpain: Illegal Cannabis Market Is Flourishing \n\nBarcelona officers recently raided a house with 800 cannabis plants grown under lamps,\u00a0reported\u00a0Reuters. Two Albanian nationals were arrested.\nAccording to the report, this is almost a daily police routine in the Spanish region of Catalonia, where the illegal cannabis market is flourishing under organized crime groups.\nThe police are usually not aimed at arresting small-scale cultivators or users who visit so-called weed clubs that rely on legal loopholes.\nIn 2022, Catalan police seized 26 tonnes of cannabis buds, three times more than in 2021.\nBarcelona ranked third among European cities with the highest cannabis in its wastewater last year, according to a study by the\u00a0EU drugs agency EMCDDA.\u00a0\n\nThe Netherlands: One Amsterdam District Considers National Pot Cultivation Trial\n\nThe city district of Amsterdam-Oost might participate in the national experiment to regulate the marijuana supply chain for coffee shops,\u00a0writes\u00a0NL Times.\u00a0\nThis project will study the feasibility of legalizing the production, distribution, and sale of marijuana.\u00a0\nContrary to popular belief, marijuana is not fully legal in the country, but the sale of cannabis in coffee shops is just tolerated which requires wholesale cannabis purchases from illegal markets.\u00a0\nThe Amsterdam mayor highlighted the importance of the project saying \u201cthe results of the experiment may eventually lead to changes in the tolerance policy, which may greatly affect the coffee shops and cannabis market in Amsterdam.\"\u00a0\nThe Ministers of Justice and Security and Health, Welfare, and Sport will make a call on whether the Amsterdam-Oost district will take part in the project. The other municipalities that are already chosen to take part in the trial include Groningen, Almere, Arnhem, Nijmegen, Zaanstad, Hellevoetsluis, Breda, Tilburg, Maastricht, and Heerlen.\nPhoto: Benzinga edit with image from amedeoemaja on Shutterstock\n\n\u00a0\n",

      "body": "\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has proposed two additional rate hikes by the end of the year as a strategy to mitigate the ongoing inflationary pressures that are contributing to economic volatility.\nDespite the uncertainty triggered by the proposed rate hikes, the S&P 500 index has demonstrated remarkable resilience, continuing its upward trend and indicating a positive economic outlook for the United States.\nLooking ahead, if the S&P 500 maintains its current momentum, there's anticipation that it could break its all-time high of $4818 and potentially push beyond this level, serving as a testament to the market's capacity to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing economic environment.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell proposes two rate hikes before year-end, hoping to alleviate inflationary pressures amidst a volatile economic landscape.\nSurprisingly, the S&P 500 SPY index remains resilient, defying these challenging circumstances and pointing to a positive outlook for the U.S. economy.\nIn a time of constant change and uncertainty, the S&P 500 stands strong as a symbol of resilience.\nDespite a major drop in October 2022, when it reached a low of $3491, the index has made a remarkable comeback.\nSince then, it has risen by 26.92%. The positive trend has continued into 2023, moving up 15.14% so far.\nThe S&P 500 surpassed a significant resistance level of $4325 on June 12, 2023. However, it encountered some resistance at $4448.\nAs a result, the market experienced a temporary correction and price retraced 2.66% to retest the previous resistance turned support level at $4325.\nThis benchmark of $4325 acted as a financial springboard, propelling price back up to a high of $4448. The fluctuating trajectory reflects the underlying conflicts of supply and demand, as well as the emotions of fear and greed that drive the financial market.\n\nAs we enter the next phase of the year, the focus is on the S&P 500's ability to sustain its current momentum and reach new milestones.\nIf price can keep climbing, we expect the index to surpass its previous record of $4818, and potentially surge even higher.\nAfter the closing bell on Thursday, June 29, the stock closed at $4396.45 trading up by 0.46%.\n",

      "body": "Morgan Stanley\u00a0analyst Alex Straton reiterated an\u00a0Overweight rating\u00a0on the shares of\u00a0Nike Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:NKE) and lowered the price target from $130 to $127.\nNike reported a\u00a0Q4 revenue growth of 10% Y/Y to $12.82 billion, beating the analyst consensus of $12.59 billion.\nEPS of $0.66 missed the\u00a0analyst consensus of $0.67.\nThe results reflected better-than-expected revenue & gross margin, offset by higher SG&A on higher wages, variable DTC costs, & increased demand creation expense, said the analyst.\nWhile the analyst views the 4Q23 report as mostly as expected, it has to be acknowledged the EPS miss is NKE\u2019s first ex-COVID EPS miss for the company since 4Q19.\nThe wholesale deceleration on the back of partnership news with\u00a0Macy\u2019s Inc\u00a0(NYSE:M) &\u00a0Designer Brands Inc\u00a0(NYSE:DBI) was arguably better than feared, added the analyst.\nThe 16% y/y China revenue growth fell short of the buyside\u2019s 30%+ bogey, & represented NKE\u2019s lowest underlying growth rate of the year, the analyst noted.\nThe analyst said wage inflation, variable DTC costs, & increased demand creation spend pushed SG&A growth to 8%.\nNKE exited 4Q23 with inventory flat y/y, continuing the trend with its third decline in mid-single digit% reduction q/q.\nWhile NKE certainly screens clean on an inventory to forward sales basis & management indicated the retail channel seems healthy as well, the analyst admits the recent sportswear channel checks suggest otherwise.\nThe contacts the analyst spoke with confirmed sportswear inventory remains bloated industry-wide,with NKE no exception, & could remain that way through NKE\u2019s 1H24.\nThe analyst specified that Nike\u2019s mostly as-expected 4Q23 print and better-than-feared initial FY guide seemed enough to stem further pressure from the bears near-term but not stellar enough to embolden the incremental buyer to step in.\nThe ongoing wholesale strategy debate may prevent the cautious incremental buyer near-term, concluded the analyst.\nAlso Read:\u00a0What 4 Nike Analyst Think Of The Q4 Print After Earnings Miss\n\n\nPrice Action: NKE shares are trading lower by 2.69% at $110.32 on the last check Friday.\n",

      "body": "\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has proposed two additional rate hikes by the end of the year as a strategy to mitigate the ongoing inflationary pressures that are contributing to economic volatility.\nDespite the uncertainty triggered by the proposed rate hikes, the S&P 500 index has demonstrated remarkable resilience, continuing its upward trend and indicating a positive economic outlook for the United States.\nLooking ahead, if the S&P 500 maintains its current momentum, there's anticipation that it could break its all-time high of $4818 and potentially push beyond this level, serving as a testament to the market's capacity to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing economic environment.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell proposes two rate hikes before year-end, hoping to alleviate inflationary pressures amidst a volatile economic landscape.\nSurprisingly, the S&P 500 SPY index remains resilient, defying these challenging circumstances and pointing to a positive outlook for the U.S. economy.\nIn a time of constant change and uncertainty, the S&P 500 stands strong as a symbol of resilience.\nDespite a major drop in October 2022, when it reached a low of $3491, the index has made a remarkable comeback.\nSince then, it has risen by 26.92%. The positive trend has continued into 2023, moving up 15.14% so far.\nThe S&P 500 surpassed a significant resistance level of $4325 on June 12, 2023. However, it encountered some resistance at $4448.\nAs a result, the market experienced a temporary correction and price retraced 2.66% to retest the previous resistance turned support level at $4325.\nThis benchmark of $4325 acted as a financial springboard, propelling price back up to a high of $4448. The fluctuating trajectory reflects the underlying conflicts of supply and demand, as well as the emotions of fear and greed that drive the financial market.\n\nAs we enter the next phase of the year, the focus is on the S&P 500's ability to sustain its current momentum and reach new milestones.\nIf price can keep climbing, we expect the index to surpass its previous record of $4818, and potentially surge even higher.\nAfter the closing bell on Thursday, June 29, the stock closed at $4396.45 trading up by 0.46%.\n",

      "body": "GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) was trading slightly lower Friday, continuing to consolidate after rising 11.17% between June 26 and Wednesday, which has set the stock into a bull flag pattern.\nThe bull flag pattern is created with a sharp rise higher forming the pole, which is then followed by a consolidation pattern that brings the stock lower between a channel with parallel lines or into a tightening triangle pattern.\nFor bearish traders, the \"trend is your friend\" (until it's not) and the stock may continue downwards within the following channel for a short period of time. Aggressive traders may decide to short the stock at the upper trendline and exit the trade at the lower trendline.\nBullish traders will want to watch for a break up from the upper descending trendline of the flag formation, on high volume, for an entry. When a stock breaks up from a bull flag pattern, the measured move higher is equal to the length of the pole and should be added to the lowest price within the flag.\nA bull flag is negated when a stock closes a trading day below the lower trendline of the flag pattern or if the flag falls more than 50% down the length of the pole.\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\nThe GameStop Chart: The measured move, if GameStop breaks up bullishly from the flag formation, is about 12%, which suggests the stock could rise toward $27.50. Bullish traders want to see the stock break up from the downward sloping flag on higher-than-average volume to indicate the pattern was recognized, which would also confirm a new uptrend.\n\nThe consolidation within the flag has been taking place on lower-than-average volume, which is healthy. The candlesticks within the flag also have lower wicks, which suggests bulls are buying the dip when the stock falls under $25.\nThe stock is also trading above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), with the 50-day SMA about to cross above the 200-day. If GameStop continues to trade above the levels for another day or two, the 50-day SMA will cross above the 200-day, which will cause a golden cross to form.\nBearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and knock GameStop down under the eight-day exponential moving average, which would negate the bull flag. If that happens, the stock could continue to retrace toward the 200-day SMA.\nGameStop has resistance above at $26.55 and $28.34 and support below at $24.03 and $21.89.\n\nRead Next:\u00a0GameStop Film 'Dumb Money' Stars Paul Dano, Pete Davidson, Seth Rogen: Cast Details, First Trailer Released\u00a0\u00a0\nPhoto via Shutterstock.\u00a0\n",

      "body": "How can cannabis businesses optimize cash flow and achieve financial stability in a challenging industry with limited financing options?\nThrough turnaround management, financial guidance, and operational optimization, cannabis companies can overcome operational hurdles and achieve financial health by prioritizing cash flow management, credibility-building, and value maximization.\nConsulting firms such as Emerald Peak Partners (EPP)\u00a0\u2014 founded by industry veterans, Tom Lynch and Tim Bossidy\u00a0\u2014 specializing in turnaround management in the cannabis, retail, and CPG sectors, can help cannabis businesses navigate these hurdles and achieve sustainable growth.\n\"Cannabis businesses face complex working capital cycles with limited financing options. Unlike mature industries with access to revolving lines of credit, this is not the case for all but the largest MSOs. Optimizing cash flow by understanding the impact of inventory levels, payment delays, and production efficiency can yield significant improvements,\" Bossidy told Benzinga in an exclusive interview.\nFinancial Health in Cannabis Businesses\nBossidy highlighted some of the key advantages of working with EPP, primarily its ability to develop detailed cash models tailored to the unique working capital cycles of cannabis businesses.\nIn an industry where access to financing is limited, Bossidy noted the importance of optimizing cash flow. By analyzing factors such as inventory levels, payment delays, and production efficiency, EPP helps clients identify areas for improvement and implement strategies that lead to significant enhancements in cash flow.\nEPP's cash flow management strategies have already demonstrated their effectiveness.\n\"We had a client in cultivation and manufacturing where previous management solely focused on unit cost. By optimizing order size, re-order interval, and per unit cost, and increasing labor allocation for harvest and room turnover, we achieved a significant multi-million dollar positive impact,\" Bossidy explained.\nMitigating Risks, Maximizing Value\nWhen it comes to proposing and reviewing reorganization plans, EPP takes into account the unique goals and projected cash flow of each firm.\n\"We prioritize areas within our control, such as cost management, leadership selection, and internal processes. While growing sales is important, we must address immediate cash bleed during the initial stage of a turnaround,\" Bossidy emphasized.\nEPP's deep financial expertise and understanding of the restructuring process also prove invaluable for navigating potential disruptions and legal hurdles in the cannabis industry.\n\u201cWe recently had a client in a mature market who had a strong brand and product. We felt in the long-term, their position was more defensible at the top of the market, so even though we went through our exercises of working capital management, efficiencies, automation, and cost, we also focused on continuing to improve quality and create new solventless SKUs that showcased quality. Sales climbed dramatically from where we started, and we believe this client is better positioned for a challenging future environment,\u201d Bossidy said.\nEPP's knowledge of the entire restructuring playbook, combined with competent legal counsel, helps businesses mitigate liabilities and maximize value in insolvency scenarios.\n\"Without access to Chapter 11, directors and officers must work with experts like us and competent lawyers who understand the entire restructuring playbook for cannabis companies. Neglecting proper processes, corporate governance, and value maximization in insolvency scenarios can result in significant liability,\" Bossidy added.\nRelated News\n\nAgainst All Odds",

      "body": "Apparel and footwear company Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) is one of the best-known brands in the world. The company completed an IPO in 1980 and has been publicly traded since.\nHere\u2019s a look at a key event in the company\u2019s history that helped Nike\u2019s future and how it helped investors along the way.\nWhat Happened: From 1972 to 1984, Nike\u2019s sales increased from $3 million to $919 million. The company saw a strong run of success as customers flocked to the company\u2019s shoes and apparel.\nTrends changed in 1984 and the company had its first earnings decline. Earnings dropped 29% in fiscal 1984. Two quarters in 1985 saw the company post its first-ever losses.\nThings changed after the company signed Michael Jordan, who had just won an NCAA Championship at the University of North Carolina, to an endorsement deal.\nThe deal with Jordan came at a risk for Nike as it offered to name a shoe after him and pay out royalties alongside the normal contract.\nOn April 1, 1985, Nike released Air Jordan shoes in six cities. The shoes quickly became a top seller for the footwear company.\nJordan wore the shoes in NBA games, despite getting fined by the league for not meeting a policy on uniforms and shoe colors. Nike happily paid the fine and enjoyed huge attention for its new product.\nThe marketing from Jordan wearing the shoes and commercials including the famous \u201cWho said man was not meant to fly\u201d ad featuring Jordan soaring above the rim helped push the demand for the shoes.\nOver $55 million in Air Jordans had sold by mid-June 1995.\nToday, Air Jordan has endorsement deals with colleges, soccer teams and individual NBA athletes and is one of the top brands in the company\u2019s portfolio.\nJordan made $1.8 billion from his Nike deal and the company has enjoyed strong returns along the way.\nThe story of signing Jordan to a Nike deal became a major motion picture from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) titled \"Air,\" starring\u00a0Ben Affleck,\u00a0Matt Damon and Viola Davis.\nRelated Link: Nike Q4 Earnings Highlights: Revenue Beat, EPS Miss, China Sales, Inventory Update And More\nInvesting $1,000 in Nike: With Nike struggling in 1985, investors may have headed for the exits as other competitors were taking market share and seeing leads in sports outside of running.\nInvestors could have seen an investment opportunity when Nike signed Jordan, the third pick in the 1984 NBA Draft and highly touted prospect.\nShares of Nike traded at a split-adjusted price of 14 cents per share on April 1, 1985. A $1,000 investment in Nike stock at the time could have purchased the equivalent of 7,142.86 shares of NKE.\nThose shares would be worth $791,143.17 today based on a share price of $110.76 for Nike at the time of writing.\nWhile not every new product or partnership announced by a company will be life-changing such as\u00a0signing\u00a0Jordan, an all-time NBA great, investors can look for opportunities that could transform companies.\nRead Next: Michael Jordan Gave Ben Affleck 2 Demands To Secure His Blessing On \"Air\" Movie\u00a0\nPhoto: Michael Jordan, sneaker via Shutterstock; Logo via Nike\n\u00a0\n",

      "title": "Marijuana Possession Limits Doubled In Nevada, Crowded Weed Market In New Mexico And More Pot Reg Updates",
      "body": "Arizona Shoppers Increase Marijuana Spending\n\nIn March, Arizona recreational cannabis sales surpassed the nine-figure mark for the first time since the marijuana market kicked off in 2021, reaching $100.7 million, reported Green Market Report citing the Department of Revenue's data. Medical cannabis sales for the same period totaled $32 million.\nIn April, the adult-use market saw a slowdown garnering $86.4 million in sales, with $30.2 million in sales on the medicinal side.\nThe Grand Canyon State welcomed adult-use cannabis legalization in November. Three months later, it commenced the sales. Recreational marijuana sales hovered around $1.4 billion in 2022, much like in 2021.\n\nNew Mexico Group Looks to Rebalance Cannabis Industry\n\nIn New Mexico, a group of nearly 100 dispensaries, producers, and private citizens seeks to make the state's cannabis industry less crowded.\nThe coalition blamed market saturation of regulated and illegal cannabis products in New Mexico.\n\"These two factors are resulting in homegrown small and medium-sized cannabis businesses being forced to close their doors or lay off staff,\" the group said in a letter to the governor's office. \"Our local businesses simply cannot compete with the illicit market and the immense oversupply.\"\nEver since New Mexico legalized adult-use cannabis, the state has issued over 1000 cannabis dispensary licenses.\n\nMissouri Preps For Cannabis Microbusiness Opportunity\n\nMissourians interested in joining the state's cannabis market can buy a ticket for the lottery to get in, reported Missouri Independent. The cost of their ticket is a $1,500 application fee for the chance to partake in a lottery, where a limited number of cannabis microbusiness licenses are up for grabs.\nIf they do not get selected, the payment is refundable.\nMissouri is expected to distribute 48 microbusiness licenses this year under Amendment 3. The 2022 law expanded the existing medical cannabis program statewide by allowing licensees who already sold cannabis statewide to serve both medical and non-medical purchasers.\nThe \"microbusiness license\" program seeks to hand out cannabis licenses to those in communities negatively affected by marijuana criminalization.\nAbigail Vivas, the state's new chief equity officer, held several outreach events recently, during which she went through all the eligibility requirements for a microbusiness license.\n\nNew Regulations in California Capital Target Illegal Cannabis Grows\n\nUnder a new measure, the Sacramento City Council voted 8-1 on allowing the Police Department to fine those illegally cultivating cannabis on commercial properties and vacant lots.\nSince 2017, the city has had a law in place whereby police can only issue fines for illegal grows at residences. The policy change addresses the trend of illicit growth decreasing in homes but increasing elsewhere.\n\nMarijuana Possession Limits In Nevada Doubled\n\nA comprehensive marijuana reform bill, aiming to increase marijuana possession limits and remove barriers in the industry, was signed by Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo.\nSponsored by Sen. Dallas Harris (D), the cannabis omnibus legislation passed the Assembly by a vote of 28-14 earlier this month.\nBill SB277 more than doubles the personal possession limit from one ounce to 2.5 ounces and allows for the possession of larger quantities of cannabis concentrates.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Wesley Gibbs on Unsplash\n",

Biotricity expects its common stock to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market as of the commencement of trading on July 3, 2023.\nThe reverse stock split was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and is intended to increase the per share trading price of the Company's common stock to satisfy the\u00a0$1.00\u00a0minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nAt the effective time of the reverse stock split, every 6 shares of Biotricity common stock issues and outstanding will be combined into one share of common stock issued and outstanding.

No fractional shares of common stock will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split and instead fractional shares will be rounded up.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"The reverse split is a necessary step in our efforts to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq market.

      "body": "The recent agreement between the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) marks a potential shift in the relationship between professional sports and cannabis.\nEffective from July 1 until the 2029-2030 season, the NBA has removed marijuana from its Prohibited Substances List for athletes, enabling them to endorse CBD companies and invest in cannabis businesses.\nThis policy change presents new opportunities for athletes to engage in investments, endorsements, and sponsorships within the evolving legal cannabis industry.\nHowever, caution is necessary for players considering partnerships with cannabis companies.\nSee Also:\u00a0NBA Drops Cannabis Testing For Players, Can The NFL Be Far Behind?\nLawyers caution that there are reputational risks involved, as cannabis still carries a stigma and remains federally illegal. Player endorsements of cannabis products could be viewed as promoting drug use, potentially harming their reputation and future endorsement prospects, reported Bloomberg Law.\nLegal concerns may also arise if players face legal repercussions if they invest in companies operating in states where marijuana remains illegal. Similarly, cannabis companies could encounter legal issues by selling athlete-endorsed products in states with strict regulations governing celebrity endorsements and marketing.\nRegulatory challenges are another factor to consider.\nPlayers entering partnerships with cannabis companies may encounter obstacles or even violate the law if proper precautions are not taken. Conflicts of interest could arise if players' financial interests clash with NBA policies, and lack of experience in investing or business partnerships may pose additional challenges, explained Fox Rothschild\u2019s Vijay Choksi and Cameron Baker.\nUnder the new agreement, players are allowed to invest in CBD companies and hold active, controlling interests in such businesses. However, they are prohibited from holding active, controlling interests in companies producing marijuana with THC levels exceeding 0.3%. Similarly, while CBD product promotion is permitted, endorsing marijuana products containing THC above 0.3% remains restricted.\nWhile the NBA's policy change signals a significant shift in its stance on cannabis, players must navigate potential legal, reputational, and regulatory risks associated with partnering with cannabis companies.\nRead Now:\u00a0NBA's Historic Agreement Lifts Marijuana Ban, Allows Players To Invest In Companies\nPhoto: Courtesy Of\u00a0MontyLov\u00a0On\u00a0Unsplash\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n",

Analysts expected Nvidia to triumph ahead of its rivals\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD).\nRaymond James\u00a0Srini Pajjuri reiterated a Strong Buy on the stock with a price target of $450 following a virtual investor meeting with VP of IR Simona Jankowski.\u00a0\nWhile management did not comment on near-term trends, the analyst walked away comfortably with his view that Gen AI adoption will continue to drive strong growth for the next several quarters.\u00a0\nDue to strong demand from other markets, management does not expect a material impact from potential new China export controls in the near term.\nDemand for Gen AI model Training at CSPs is giving the company strong visibility through year-end (previously stated), while Inferencing is also growing significantly due to LLM model complexity.\nA100 demand is still strong, but the mix will shift to H100 over time, which could further help margins.\nAI adoption across verticals drives interest in NVDA's full-stack offerings and foundation models.\nManagement is not overly concerned about competition, given its performance leadership and eco-system advantages.\nThe stock has gained close to 200% YTD outshining its rivals courtesy of the AI frenzy.\nPrice Action:\u00a0NVDA shares traded higher by 4% at $424.53 on the last check Friday.\nPhoto by Mizter_X94 via Pixabay\n",

      "body": "Oppenheimer\u00a0analyst Brian Nagel reiterated an\u00a0Outperform rating\u00a0on the shares of\u00a0Academy Sports and Outdoors Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0ASO) with a price target of $85.\nThe analyst, through an analysis,\u00a0discovered that 143, or 53%, of the 269 stores currently operated by Academy Sports and Outdoors are situated within 5 miles of a unit operated by\u00a0Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc\u00a0(NYSE:DKS).\nASO is focused upon expanding further into existing markets and opening new stores in new geographies, said the analyst.\nAccording to the analyst, successful new unit expansion represents a key intermediate- to longer-term expansion driver for ASO.\nBetter brand alignment, partnerships, and consumer knowledge allows ASO to more effectively localize product assortments, particularly in newer operating geographies, which the analyst thinks is the key to ASO\u2019s expansion strategy.\nAlso, according to the analyst, the company represents an increasingly omnichannel-enabled operator, focused more intently on the outdoor category and serving more mass-market-oriented consumers.\nUnder the guidance of new senior leadership, ASO improved operational disciplines and set a path for better store productivity and a return to steady unit expansion in existing and new markets, said the analyst.\nThe analyst is positive that for the next several quarters, structural improvements within the company\u2019s unique business model should turn clearer and encourage investors to award shares a multiple at least consistent with those afforded equities of other, leading operators within consumer and retail.\nPrice Action: ASO shares are trading higher by 1.35% at $53.87 on the last check Friday.\n",

The Nasdaq 100 had its heyday at the end of 1999 and then hit the peak of the dot-com bubble in March 2000. \nThe first half of 2000 marked a flat performance for the index, before ultimately succumbing to the ravages of the bubble burst over the next two years.\n\nThe ensuing downturn served as a painful lesson of the dangers of unchecked exuberance and unsustainable valuations.\nAlthough financial markets don\u2019t always exactly replicate historical patterns, the words of Spanish philosopher George Santayana ring true: \u201cThose who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\u201d\nThe striking similarity between the Nasdaq 100\u2019s recent surge and the gains observed during the dot-com bubble suggests a need for investor caution.\nRead also: AI Frenzy Helps Nasdaq 100 Outshine Russell 2,000 And Soar To Dot-Com Bubble Highs\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

      "body": "President Joe Biden\u2019s youngest brother, Frank Biden, recently called SiriusXM radio host Michael Smerconish and revealed that the U.S. President has been \u201cvery open-minded\u201d in conversations held between the two around the medical benefits of psychedelics.\n\u201cThe question is... is the world, is the U.S. ready for this?\u201d the younger Biden asked, adding that he has done \u201ca great deal\u201d of research on the topic as a recovering alcoholic.\n\u201cWe are on the cusp of a consciousness that needs to be brought about to solve a lot of the problems in and around addiction, but as importantly, to make us aware of the fact that we\u2019re all one people, and we\u2019ve got to come together,\" he said.\nSo far, the White House has not commented on the above. Still, there have been hints toward the recognition of these substances as alternative mental health treatments, including considerations to establishing a federal task force for monitoring the psychedelics space as well as the National Institute for Drug Abuse\u2019s (NIDA) more frequent launch of research grants.\nIn June, Congress introduced a bipartisan bill creating a $75 million research grant program for psychedelics as a treatment among active duty military members. In March, legislation was reintroduced, requesting an update on the breakthrough therapies\u2019 scheduling.\nAnd last year, a Congressional Psychedelics Caucus was created.\nBetween 2017 and 2018, the FDA designated both MDMA and psilocybin as \u201cbreakthrough therapies,\u201d providing an expedited path for their clinical development and both substances are currently advancing late-stage in-human trials toward treating Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) respectively.\nMore recently, the federal agency has given another step toward supporting clinical trials with psychedelics by releasing a non-binding draft guidance for researchers designing studies of the kind.\nThe news also comes on the heels of this year\u2019s largest psychedelics gathering organized by the legendary nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) where attendants listened to speakers as diverse as NFL star quarterback Aaron Rodgers, actor and environmentalist Jaden Smith, and former Texas GOP Governor Rick Perry, on these substances\u2019 healing potential.\nPhoto: Benzinga edit with photo by\u00a0Anne Mathiasz and AlenKadr on Shutterstock and Adam Schultz on Wikimedia Commons.\n",

      "body": "Needham\u00a0analyst Laura Martin reiterates\u00a0a Hold rating on\u00a0Walt Disney Co\u00a0(NYSE:DIS). The re-rating reflects Martin's belief that consensus estimates for DIS are too high owing to DTC losses and another year of weak earnings from linear TV and the box office.\u00a0\nLonger-term, she believes DIS's asset mix of both digital and physical assets (i.e., an Omniverse) maximizes its economic value capture, which DIS benefits from generative AI, and that DIS will be a takeover target owing to its potential as a streaming winner and high-quality content libraries with a hit film and TV franchises to drive mass adoption.\nMartin lowered her 3Q FY23 DIS estimates, owing primarily to Linear Networks (DMED) and items below operating income.\u00a0\nThe analyst now expects 3Q DIS revenues of $14.7 billion (up 4% Y/Y, 2% below her prior estimate), OI of $3.2 billion (down 11% Y/Y, 14% below her previous estimate), and Adj EPS of $1.06 (down 3% Y/Y, 20% below her prior estimate).\nLinear Networks: Martin estimates revenue of $6.9 billion (down 4% Y/Y and 4% below her previous estimate) and estimates OI of $1.85 billion (down 25% Y/Y and 22% below her last estimate).\u00a0\nDTC: Martin estimates revenue of $5.8 billion (up 15% Y/Y and no change) and an OI Loss of $760 million (improved by 28% Y/Y and no change).\u00a0\nContent Sales/Licensing and Other: Martin estimates revenue of $2.2 billion (up 2% Y/Y and no change) and an OI Loss of $200 million (down from $27 million in 3Q22 and no change).\u00a0\nDisney Parks, Experiences, and Products: Martin estimates revenue of $8.1 billion (up 9% Y/Y and no change) and OI of $2.3 billion (up 5% Y/Y and no change).\u00a0\nFor FY23, Martin now estimates revenues of $90.1 billion (up 9% Y/Y, 0.6% below her prior estimate), OI of $12.6 billion (up 4% Y/Y, 4% below her initial estimate), and Adj EPS of $3.80 (up 8% Y/Y, 8% below her previous estimate).\u00a0\nFor FY24, Martin maintains her estimates at revenues of $96.1 billion (up 7% Y/Y), OI of $16 billion (up 27% Y/Y), and Adj EPS of $5.49 (up 44% Y/Y).\nPrice Action:\u00a0DIS shares traded higher by 0.50% at $89.45 on the last check Friday.\n",

      "body": "What happened: On Thursday a total of 5,079.60 Ether (CRYPTO: ETH) worth $9,841,681, based on the current value of Ethereum at time of publication ($1,937.49), was burned from Ethereum transactions. Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation.\nWhy it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.\nSee Also: How to Buy Ethereum & When Will Ethereum 2.0 Launch\nEthereum is currently issuing new Ether at a rate of 4% per year, although this is expected to decrease to around 0.5-1% as a part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Once this occurs, many speculate that the burn rate of Ether will be greater than the token's issuance, causing ETH to become a deflationary currency.\nThe net annualized issuance rate for Ether yesterday was -5.87%.\nData provided by Glassnode ",

      "body": "The European Commission has reportedly made arrangements with\u00a0Pfizer Inc\u00a0(NYSE:PFE) and various European pharmaceutical companies to secure the capacity to produce up to 325 million vaccines annually for potential future global health crises.\nIn May, the European Commission agreed with\u00a0BioNTech SE\u00a0(NASDAQ:BNTX) and\u00a0Pfizer\u00a0on adapting the existing contract on vaccines against Covid-19, including a reduction in the quantity of doses purchased by EU countries under the contract and pushing the\u00a0delivery deadline to 2026.\nUnder the agreement, companies will maintain their facilities in a state of readiness, monitor supply chains, and stockpile as needed, to enable rapid production if a new public health crisis arises,\u00a0Reuters\u00a0reported.\nHowever, vaccine equity activists caution that this plan could repeat the \"vaccine apartheid\" observed during the COVID-19 crisis.\nPfizer's plants in Ireland and Belgium have been chosen by the Commission to reserve mRNA vaccine production capacity; Spanish firms Reig Jofre and Laboratorios Hipra SA have been chosen for protein-based vaccine capacity and Bilthoven Biologicals B.V. of the Netherlands for vector-based vaccines.\nPfizer acknowledges the urgent need for improved pandemic preparedness and response planning and asserts that it has taken significant measures to prepare for potential future global disease outbreaks without specifying these measures.\nReig Jofre reveals that its deal with the EU reserves capacity for four years, with the option to extend up to a maximum of eight years, though financial details were undisclosed.\nThe World Health Organization has recommended that governments and manufacturers reserve up to 20% of any tests, vaccines, or treatments for\u00a0distribution in poorer nations\u00a0to avoid a recurrence of the \"catastrophic failure\" experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggestion is part of a draft global pandemic agreement currently under discussion.\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n",

Penguin Computing has 25 years of experience designing, installing, and managing supercomputers and HPC systems.\nSGH mentioned it could deploy 50-60K\u00a0NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs for AI training at scale. For example,\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) completed the second phase build-out of its AI Research SuperCluster, with Penguin as the implementation partner.\u00a0\nSGH helps companies design an optimized AI architecture compute system for specific HPC and AI workloads, node provisioning, and clustering monitoring.\u00a0\nGill highlights that IPS sales will be lumpy due to the unpredictability of large installations and government spending plans.\nRFQ funnel is growing for AI implementations, although the company is selective on which projects to choose to ensure higher margins.\nThe gross margin profile will improve on a mix shift toward IPS and services.\u00a0\nThe analyst sees the valuation expanding as the revenue mix shifts toward AI and HPC.\nRosenblatt\u00a0analyst Kevin Cassidy reiterates SMART with a Buy and a $35 price target.\nSGH delivered a solid quarter and outlook. All three business units\u2019 revenue has stabilized and is positioned for growth.\u00a0\nCustomer engagements for AI and HPC have increased significantly in multiple end markets such as Oil & Gas, Financial, Healthcare, Research, and Cloud.\u00a0\nManagement\u2019s strategy is to select customers needing SGH\u2019s customization and servicing capabilities.\u00a0\nCassidy expects this business\u2019 visibility will increase in the next quarter. The Memory Solutions and LED businesses are recovering, though not at the pace he had been modeling.\u00a0\nThe analyst lowered his estimates for this slower growth.\u00a0\nThere will likely be no downside to non-GAAP EPS for the Brazil divestiture. He continues to view SGH as a great way to play the secular AI theme at a reasonable valuation.\nPrice Action:\u00a0SGH shares are trading higher by 9.8% to $29.25 on the last check Friday.\n",

      "title": "Microsoft CEO Has 'No Love' For Console Exclusives, Blames Sony; District Judge Says 'It's Hard' To Decide On Activision Tie-Up",
      "body": "Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella has placed the blame for the existence of console exclusives on Sony Group Corp. (NYSE:SONY), saying that he would prefer to eliminate them altogether.\nWhat Happened:\u00a0During his testimony at a hearing in the lawsuit filed by the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission against\u00a0Microsoft, Nadella addressed the issue of exclusives and directed his criticism toward\u00a0the PlayStation manufacturer.\nSee Also:\u00a0Activision Raises Alarm As FTC Considers Pausing Microsoft Takeover: 'We Don't See How This Will Continue'\n\"If it was up to me I would love to get rid of the entire exclusives on consoles, but that\u2019s not for me to define especially as a low-share player in the console market,\" the CEO stated, according to Kotaku.\n\"The dominant player there [Sony] has defined market competition using exclusives, so that\u2019s the world we live in. I have no love for that world.\"\nWhy It's Important:\u00a0This statement contradicts Microsoft's activity in recent years. Although exclusives have long been employed by major console manufacturers to entice consumers to their respective platforms, the tech giant's recent acquisitions have resulted in several games becoming console exclusives.\nFor example, Arkane Austin's \"Redfall,\" originally intended for the PS5, became an Xbox exclusive after Microsoft's acquisition. Moreover, the ownership of Bethesda Game Studios by Microsoft has made upcoming titles like \"The Elder Scrolls VI\" and \"Starfield\" exclusive to Xbox.\nDoes Xbox Plan To Make All ZeniMax Games Exclusive? In addition, a chat that came to light during the final day of testimony in the FTC's hearing against Microsoft further questions the truth behind Nadella's affirmations.\nDuring the hearing, Xbox CFO Tim Stuart was questioned about a\u00a0conversation from November 2021 between he\u00a0and Xbox Vice President Matt Booty.\nThe conversation revolved around a monthly business review meeting between Xbox and ZeniMax, the video game holding company bought by Microsoft in March 2021.\nDuring the meeting,\u00a0Xbox boss Phil Spencer reportedly made a decisive call to make all ZeniMax games exclusive to the Xbox platform in the future, not just new intellectual properties.\n\"All games going forward? Not just new IP, but ALL games going forward? Wow,\" Stuart asked, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by IGN.\nThe Microsoft-ZeniMax deal has been a focal point of the FTC hearing, as it pertains to the proposed $68.7-billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) by Microsoft. The FTC has cited Xbox's decision to make titles like \"Starfield\" and \"Redfall\" exclusive as \"powerful evidence\" against the merger with Activision Blizzard.\nJudge Says 'I'm Going To Do My Best': As the hearings for a preliminary injunction in the FTC's lawsuit came to an end and both parties made their closing arguments, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley interrupted to ask for \"grounded, real-world scenarios,\" as per IGN's Rebekah Valentine.\nFor instance, when FTC lawyer James Weingarten aimed to prove that a hypothetical PlayStation customer would be compelled to switch to Xbox if \"Call of Duty\" was unavailable on their console, Corley strongly emphasized the need to consider real-world scenarios, highlighting that individuals already possess Call of Duty-capable PCs in their homes and may choose to play the game on those devices.\nRegarding the timeline for the decision, Corley acknowledged the time constraints but did not provide a specific time frame, although a decision could potentially be announced as early as Wednesday.\n\"I'm going to do my best. It's hard,\" the judge said.\nRead Next: Sony's Confidential Document Accidentally Reveals Massive Call of Duty Earnings On PlayStation\nImage credits: Anton Vierietin and FellowNeko on Shutterstock.\n",

      "body": "Needham\u00a0analyst Ryan MacDonald reiterated a Buy rating on the shares of\u00a0Accolade, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:ACCD),\u00a0raising the price target to $17 from $15.\nACCD is entering 2Q24 with a sense of optimism, notes the analyst, adding that the company's pipeline remains strong with a healthy level of demand for multiproduct adoption.\u00a0\nExpert Medical Opinion (EMO) is the most significant area of upside surprise as ACCD noted the segment is growing at a 30% rate vs. prior expectations in the recently-reported\u00a0\u00a0Q1 FY24 results.\nFirst-quarter sales of $93.2 million were up 9% Y/Y, beating the\u00a0consensus of $90.30 million.\u00a0\nAlso Read:\u00a0Accolade's Financial Forecast: Anticipating Raised Guidance and Robust Revenue Growth\nThis is driven by healthy net new customer adoption and utilization, notes the analyst.\u00a0\nVirtual Primary Care (VPC) also remains strong, bolstered not only by increased DTC demand from GLP-1 drugs, but also enterprise usage that came in ahead of targets, MacDonald adds.\u00a0\nThe analyst expects the\u00a0robust demand\u00a0environment to translate to healthy bookings throughout FY24 and remains confident in ACCD's ability to hit its FY25 targets.\nThe analyst notes the company's pipeline remains strong, with most deals multiproduct, a continued theme from last year that management believes is long-term durable.\nOn the negative side, the analyst cautioned that competition continues to grow in Accolade's end market, with vendors becoming increasingly competitive on price.\u00a0\nThis creates churn risk, pricing pressure upon renewals, and margin compression.\nPrice Action:\u00a0ACCD shares are trading higher by 9.18% to $13.80\u00a0on the last check Friday.\n",

      "body": "Shaquille O\u2019Neal was arguably one of the most unstoppable players in NBA history and made more than $280 million during his career, according to Sportrac. However, since his retirement in 2011, the player fondly known as \"The Big Diesel\"\u00a0has continued to grow his net worth through a diverse portfolio of investments, outlined in a Twitter thread by Profluence\u2019s Andrew Petcash.\u00a0\nO\u2019Neal\u00a0has one golden rule when it comes to investing: \u201cOnly invest in things that are going to change people\u2019s lives.\u201d By following this mantra, he's\u00a0invested in innovative companies like Ring, Google, and Vitamin Water.\u00a0\nAlso Read:\u00a0If You Invested $1,000 In Nike Stock When Air Jordan Shoes Were Released, Here's How Much You'd Have Now\nO\u2019Neal, like many other investors, including Warren Buffett, is also a big fan of cash-flowing businesses. At one point, the four-time NBA champion owned more than 150 Five Guys Burgers & Fries locations. He also has investments in car washes, gyms and other types of businesses.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nO'Neal has admitted that he hasn't always been financially savvy. He once confessed to spending\u00a0$1 million in a single day, a moment that served as a wake-up call for him to be more prudent with his finances. While most people may never find themselves spending a million in a day, everyone has their moments of financial realization.\nO'Neal now seems to have turned his money habits around and is using his golden rule to make long-term investments. Oh, and did I mention that he\u2019s also getting paid to perform DJ sets at major music festivals? Talk about a side hustle.\u00a0\nPetcash, who has grown a massive following on Twitter sharing threads related to athlete\u2019s finances, founded Profluence to curate information, content and data about the future of sports.

      "body": "SoFi Technologies, Inc (NASDAQ:SOFI) was trading lower Friday afternoon after suffering a high amount of volatility earlier in the trading session, which was triggered when the Supreme Court blocked President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to cancel student debt.\nThe move lower came despite SoFi, which provides student loans, potentially benefitting from the news.\u00a0Biden responded to the court\u2019s decision by stating that he plans to announce new actions on student loans Friday. Read more here...\nSoFi\u2019s rise higher, on June 28 and June 29, caused the stock to negate a downtrend. If the loan\u00a0provider bounces on Monday, Friday\u2019s low-of-day will confirm a new uptrend pattern.\nAn uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart.\nThe higher highs indicate the bulls are in control, while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods.\nTraders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend, with rising lower time frame moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend.\nRising longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicate a long-term uptrend.\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\nThe SoFi Chart: When SoFi spiked almost 6% higher on June 28 to reach $9.09, the stock formed a higher high, which negated the downtrend. If SoFi bounces on Monday or on Tuesday, Friday\u2019s $8.32 low-of-day will mark a higher low, which will confirm a new uptrend.\n\nIf SoFi closes the trading day under the $8.80 mark, the stock will print a doji or inverted hammer candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come on Monday. The second most likely scenario is that the stock forms an inside bar to consolidate the recent volatility.\nSoFi\u2019s eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) is trading above the 21-day EMA, which is bullish. The stock\u2019s 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is also trading above the 200-day, which indicates SoFi is experiencing a longer-term bull cycle.\nSoFi has resistance above at $9.63 and $10.57 and support below at $8.24 and $7.15.\n\nRead Next:\u00a0Wall Street Poised To Wrap Up Strong First Half, Apple Hits $3 Trillion, Nasdaq Surges 38% YTD: Friday's Market Drivers\nPhoto via Shutterstock.\u00a0\n",

LumiraDx submitted a traditional 510(k) Dual Submission for LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag Ultra with CLIA Waiver for the commercial distribution at point of care of the LumiraDx Platform, including the LumiraDx Instrument, with the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Antigen (Ag) Ultra test, and the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag Quality Control Swab Kit.\n\u00a0\nThis significant milestone marks a crucial step forward in continued access and expansion into the United States for the LumiraDx Platform. LumiraDx had earlier received various Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for its SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests during the pandemic. This is the first time the LumiraDx Instrument has been submitted for 510(k) review and the submission underscores LumiraDx's continued commitment to providing a complete solution that meets the highest standards of performance and safety. Once reviewed, this submission should facilitate further submissions to the FDA with focus switching from the LumiraDx Instrument to assay components.\nThe LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag Ultra Test is a state-of-the-art diagnostic test that leverages LumiraDx's cutting-edge technology to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. Built upon a robust scientific foundation, the test demonstrates exceptional accuracy and reliability, ensuring confidence in its results. The test is already available in Europe and various international markets.\n\"We are thrilled to announce the submission of our first 510(k) application to the FDA for the clearance of our COVID Ultra Test,\" said Carol Adiletto-Francis, Global SVP, Clinical Regulatory & Quality at LumiraDx. \"LumiraDx remains committed to delivering innovative diagnostic solutions that address critical healthcare needs. The submission of this first 510(k) application represents a significant milestone in the company's journey towards receiving FDA approval for the COVID Ultra Test. This also forms the foundation for additional submissions of other high performing assays on the same Platform, many of which are available in Europe and elsewhere and others which are in late stages of development.\"",

      "body": "On Thursday, The FDA approved\u00a0BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc's\u00a0(NASDAQ:BMRN) Roctavian (valoctocogene roxaparvovec-rvox) gene therapy for adults\u00a0with severe hemophilia A.\nWedbush\u00a0analyst maintains BioMarin with a Neutral and raised the\u00a0price target from $69 to $73.\nThe analyst writes that with the U.S. approval, all focus turns to the U.S. commercial strategy, given the ongoing failed attempt to launch in the EU since receiving EMA approval in August 2022.\u00a0\nThe management intends to offer all payers an outcomes-based warranty that ensures payers would be reimbursed up to 100% of the WAC if the patient does not respond on a \"prorated basis\" out to 4yr post-dose.\u00a0\nManagement estimates commercial Roctavian would be available in ~2 months, with it taking ~2-5 months for a patient to receive Roctavian after expressing interest and completing eligibility testing potentially.\nBMO Capital Markets\u00a0maintains the Market Perform rating and expect the Roctavian launch to principally drive the BioMarin story in 2023/2024.\u00a0\nIt acknowledges the management saying that treated patients who are satisfied with Roctavian's effect will positively impact Roctavian's further uptake, but this dynamic will be lengthy, and it is currently unclear what portion of patients will be satisfied with Roctavian.\nBaird\u00a0analyst says BioMarin shares traded approximately flat, probably due to some investors shorting the launch and also perhaps due to some minor quibbles regarding the label (weekly ALT monitoring for the first 26 weeks and a ~50% reduction in ALL bleeds on the label, compared to around 80-90%+ reduction in treated, bleeds that BioMarin had generally been focusing in).\nIt says Roctavian's key upside potential is eventually expanding its market via future label expansions, especially into patients with less severe hemophilia A.\nPrice Action:\u00a0BMRN shares are down 1.06% at $87.99 on the last check Friday.\n",

      "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Bruce Linton Talks Changing Perceptions Of Cannabis On 'The Raz Report'",
      "body": "Bruce Linton, founder and former CEO of Canopy Growth Corp (NASDAQ:CGC), sat down with Benzinga founder Jason Raznick on Friday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Raz Report\u201d to discuss his entry into the cannabis industry, its shifting regulations and laws and the potential for medical and recreational use in the future.\nLinton\u2019s journey into the cannabis industry was sparked by observing a shift in government policies, and he likens it to the onset of the cellular era.\n\u201cCannabis to me was very similar, right? We\u2019re going to go from putting people in jail or trying to suppress, to regulate. And to me, anytime the government switches from being an oppression engine to a regulation engine, it\u2019s a tsunami of opportunity.\u201d\nChanging Perspectives On Cannabis: Looking beyond the U.S., Linton named the Netherlands as an example of a country shifting its approach to cannabis.Despite the popular belief that cannabis has been legal in the Netherlands for ages, Linton said the Dutch government is now looking to regulate the source of cannabis to create jobs, inspect the product and potentially increase tax revenue. He predicts a similar trend across Europe in the next few years.Read also: Cannabis Sales In Canada Drop By 20% While Pre-Roll Products Increase Market Share\nLinton does not smoke cannabis, but strongly advocates for people having the freedom to choose what works for them; he said he advocates for anyone feeling remorse or guilt about using cannabis.\nLinton addressed the rapidly changing perception of cannabis, noting how the stigma has decreased significantly over the last decade. His mother, a longtime patient of Canopy Growth, has benefited from using cannabis for sleep, he said. Linton On Cannabis Regulation: Raznick and Linton discussed regulation of the cannabis industry. While cannabis is now legal in about half of U.S. states, the federal government has yet to regulate the drug. The federal government will eventually regulate the industry, in Linton\u2019s view; he said cannabis is the \u201cbiggest untaxed commercial stream that exists on the planet right now.\u201d\nWhen asked what he\u2019s most proud of, Linton highlighted the global conversation around cannabis, the attraction of the capital markets to the industry and the beginning of scientific research into the benefits of cannabis. He\u2019s optimistic about the potential applications of cannabinoids for weight loss, animal care and other areas.\nReflecting on his journey, Linton commented, \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is begin to dismiss more and more the stereotypical perceptions, which makes it a legitimate file for discussion.\u201d\u00a0\nRead next: NBA Changes Cannabis Stance But It\u2019s Still Risky For Players, Legal Experts Warn\n\n\n",

      "title": "What Does Illumina's Debt Look Like?",
      "body": "Shares of Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) fell by 18.77% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Illumina has. \nIllumina Debt\nBased on Illumina's financial statement as of May 5, 2023, long-term debt is at $1.49 billion and current debt is at $749.00 million, amounting to $2.24 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.49 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $742.00 million.\nLet's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. \nInvestors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Illumina has $11.81 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.19. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry, but normal for another.\n\nWhy Debt Is Important\nDebt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.\nInterest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. \nLooking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

      "title": "French Stock Market Defies Chaos With 5-Day Winning Streak Amid Nationwide Riots",
      "body": "The French stock market, as represented by the CAC 40 index, has risen for five days this week, gaining 3.3% and marking the best weekly performance since the end of March.\nThis occurred despite the fact that nationwide protests have erupted in recent days, with images of burning streets and police use of tear gas capturing the attention of the world, highlighting the deep divisions and tensions within French society.\nThe police shooting death of a 17-year-old boy of Algerian descent in Nanterre, a Paris suburb, sparked widespread protests across the French capital, with protesters demanding justice and an end to police brutality.\nAs riots ravaged the nation, over 400 people were arrested on Thursday, and a bank in Nanterre was set on fire. Over 40,000 police officers were deployed, and public transportation was strained.\nAll of this turmoil had virtually no negative impact on the performance of French companies in the stock market. \nChart: French CAC 40 Index Rises For The 5th Straight Day, Eyes Prior All-Time Highs Set in April\n\nWhy Are French Stocks Ignoring The Civil Unrest?\nThe CAC 40 index, tracked by the iShares MSCI France ETF (NYSE:EWQ), is predominantly represented by luxury brands that generate a significant portion of revenues from international markets.\nLVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy \u2013 Louis Vuitton, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (OTCPK: LVMHF), the conglomerate of luxury product brands such as Louis Vuitton, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, Hennessy, Dior, Dom P\u00e9rignon, Givenchy and others, and headed by by the world\u2019s richest man, Bernard Arnault, accounts for 14% of the CAC 40 Index. \nAlso read: Elon Musk And Bernard Arnault Meet For Power Lunch In Paris: What The World\u2019s Two Richest Men Discussed\nFrance contributed only 8% of LVMH\u2019s total revenues in 2022, totaling 6 billion euros ($5.9 billion). Revenues of 21.5 billion euros, or 27%, came from the United States, making it the second-largest market after Asia.\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al S.A. (OTCPK: LRLCY), another CAC 40 heavyweight, generates only a small portion of its revenue domestically, with more than three quarters coming from outside Europe.\nThus, the international focus that characterizes French luxury brands has effectively created a protective shield against the impact of domestic political and social upheavals in the country where the brands are headquartered. \nLVMH Revenues By Region In 2022\nRegionRevenue (in millions of euros) in 2022ShareUnited States21,54227%Asia ex-Japan23,78530%Europe ex-France12,71716%Other markets9,63212%Japan5,4367%France6,0718%Total79,184100%\nRead now: Here\u2019s Why The World\u2019s Richest Man Has Ditched His Plans To Build A Luxury Hotel In Beverly Hills\nFrench police at a May Day protest earlier in 2023.

      "body": "Shares of Intel Inc. (NASDAQ:INTC) rose by 0.65% in the past three months. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials. One key aspect of a companies financials is its debt, but before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Intel has. \nIntel Debt\nBased on Intel's financial statement as of April 28, 2023, long-term debt is at $48.84 billion and current debt is at $1.44 billion, amounting to $50.27 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $8.23 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $42.04 billion.\nLet's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. \nTo understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Intel's $185.30 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.27. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, but average for another.\n\nImportance of Debt\nDebt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.\nHowever, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company.

However, their role in housing finance has diminished over time.\nThe FHFA initiated a review of the system in 2022, but the recent crisis in March drew greater attention to its expansive role. A report on the review is expected by the end of September, which will include recommendations for Congress and potential regulatory changes. FHFA Director Sandra Thompson has reaffirmed the commitment to release the report by the deadline.\nThe specific details of the proposed limitations and the banks they would apply to remain unclear. Legislation passed in 1989 allowed almost all banks and credit unions access to the FHLBs. The FHFA may request Congress to increase the percentage of profits that FHLBs allocate to their affordable housing program. Furthermore, regulators have discussed imposing a minimum percentage of assets in mortgages for banks seeking FHLB funding. \nAlso Read: Trump, Inner Circle Could Face More Charges As DOJ Reportedly Prepares \u2018Superseding\u2019 Indictment\nImpact on Large Banks and Recent Collapses\nRestricting access for large banks to the FHLBs has been a topic of discussion. Critics view their use of FHLB loans as an unnecessary advantage due to preferential interest rates. \nMidsize US lenders that collapsed since March, such as Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, First Republic Bank, and Silvergate Capital Corp., all relied on FHLB borrowing. The collapses have prompted scrutiny and raised questions about the relevance of FHLB loans to their respective businesses\nThe proposed changes by the FHFA have garnered support, at least among Democrats. Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY) expressed concerns during a hearing in May, suggesting that the advances to certain banks seemed unrelated to housing finance. It remains to be seen how the proposed limitations and changes will progress and gain traction on Capitol Hill.\nRead Now: Unaddressed Concerns Lurking Behind Fed\u2019s Positive Stress Test: The Most Vulnerable US Banks\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

      "body": "\u00a03D Systems\u00a0(NYSE:DDD) (\"the Company\") responded to today's announcement by Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) (\"Stratasys\") that Stratasys continues to refuse to engage with the Company to discuss a business combination transaction despite the opportunity to create superior value for Stratasys shareholders. On June 27, 2023, the Company\u00a0submitted\u00a0an enhanced proposal to combine with Stratasys in a transaction that would reward Stratasys shareholders with a package of stock and cash consideration, representing a market value of\u00a0$20.84\u00a0per Stratasys share as of the close of trading yesterday.\n\u00a0\nPresident and CEO Dr. Jeffrey Graves stated, \"The Stratasys Board has made the perplexing decision to not engage with us to reach a mutually agreed upon, friendly transaction that we believe would unlock value for all shareholders. Frankly, we are surprised that in their quick rejection, Stratasys' Board did not acknowledge or refute the merits of our proposed transaction, or respond to the market's concerns about the value destruction of the Desktop Metal merger.\"\nContinued Dr. Graves, \"We are hearing from a spectrum of Stratasys shareholders that they understand and believe that a combination between 3D Systems and Stratasys offers an unparalleled option for certainty, scale and long-term growth. This feedback from Stratasys' own shareholders only strengthens our conviction that this is the right deal at the right time. It is concerning that, as public company directors, the Stratasys Board is ignoring these signals from its investors. It is difficult to understand their rationale, which we think raises questions as to whether they have entrenched themselves in a position that demonstrates an absence of focus on maximizing shareholder value.\"\nThe Company reiterates its view of the key benefits of its proposed transaction with Stratasys:\n\nScale Drives Leadership: Delivers immediate scale for leadership in the rapidly growing and fragmented additive manufacturing industry.\nComplementary Technology Portfolio: Combination of proven technologies with limited overlap, creating a combined portfolio better positioned to service nearly every vertical in the 3D printing market today.\nSignificant Cost Synergies: Highly certain value creation potential through realization of at least\u00a0$100 million\u00a0in cost synergies across SG&A savings, R&D integration and COGS optimization, jointly identified by members of both companies' management teams during due diligence sessions in September 2022, in addition to significant revenue opportunities not currently included in 3D Systems' pro forma valuation analysis.\nIndustry Leading Financial Profile: Estimated LTM combined revenue of\u00a0$1.2 billion\u00a0and ~$150 million\u00a0in pro forma cash on the combined company balance sheet with a combined ~12%\u00a0EBITDA margin1, and no debt or equity financing contemplated.\nMeaningful Growth Opportunities from Regenerative Medicine: Unmatched bioprinting leadership potential, with a clear road map for human applications, including human trials for 3D printed lungs anticipated by 2026.\n\t\u00a0\n\n3D Systems continues to believe Stratasys is relying on assumptions that are unfounded and unreasonable in order to proceed with the proposed merger with Desktop Metal. These assumptions include:\n\nA Sudden and Significant Shift in Projected Desktop Metal Performance: Stratasys management's EBITDA projections for Desktop Metal unrealistically assume sudden and meteoric growth and the realization of speculative revenue synergies by Desktop Metal, a company that has not delivered on its growth prospects or any of its financial commitments since its de-SPAC \"IPO\" in 2020.\nTurnaround of a 28-year-old Metals Technology: Stratasys continues to tout Desktop Metal's binder jet technology as the future of mass-produced additively manufactured metal products, but after nearly three decades, all players focused on binder jet metals have only amassed a\u00a04%\u00a0share of the total market, largely due to inferior technology. Binder jet technology continues to face significant challenges to demonstrate its viability, achieve scale for mass production and generate a profit.\nUnrealistic Cost Synergy Assumptions: Stratasys has stated the Desktop Metal transaction will result in\u00a0$50 million\u00a0of cost synergies. The Company does not believe that is achievable. This\u00a0$50 million\u00a0is incremental to the\u00a0$100 million\u00a0of standalone cost reductions previously announced by Desktop Metal, which equates to\u00a060%\u00a0of Desktop Metal's 2022 operating expenses.\nHighly Speculative Revenue Synergies: Stratasys cites significant value creation potential through the realization of speculative revenue synergies from manufacturing and mass production. The Company believes investors should be skeptical of such revenue synergies as they are hard to establish and forecast until actually achieved.\nHighly Speculative and Unsupported Multiple Re-rating: To support its rejection of the 3D Systems proposal, Stratasys published a valuation analysis that predicated\u00a065%\u00a0of the potential uplift from the proposed Desktop Metal merger on a multiple re-rating that 3D Systems believes is highly speculative and unsupported.\nAn Inferior Financial Profile: The Company's analysis shows that the combination with Desktop Metal will create a combined company with lower pro forma revenue, lower gross profit, negative EBITDA margin and negative free cash flow. 3D Systems believes Desktop Metal's historical track record of operating losses, impairments and cash burn will introduce significant risk to Stratasys' financial profile in the coming years.\n\nDr. Graves concluded, \"We have shown a willingness to negotiate with the Stratasys Board and remain flexible and open to engaging in productive discourse in pursuit of a friendly, negotiated transaction. We are committed to making this combination a reality.\"\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (US) LLP, together with Herzog, Fox & Neeman in Israel, is acting as legal counsel to 3D Systems.",

      "body": "The S&P 500 gapped up 0.59% to start the trading day on Friday and continued to edge higher intraday to close out the first half of 2023 up about 16%. This run was\u00a0led by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which crossed the $3 trillion market-cap level.\nThe index has been guided\u00a0higher by the companies with the highest weighting, with all the top five holdings within the S&P 500 up significantly since the start of the year.\nSince the Dec. 30 market close, Apple\u00a0surged about 47%, Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) increased 44%, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose almost 55%, NVIDIA Corporation skyrocketed a whopping 188% and Tesla\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) soared about 113%.\nThe S&P 500 and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) are showing signs the local top may be in\u00a0and a retracement, at least to start the second half of 2023, may be in the cards because they have formed triple top patterns on the daily chart.\nThe triple top pattern on the S&P 500 has printed at 4448.87 and the SPY has formed the pattern at $443.90.\nAlthough a pullback is likely to come over the short-term, especially heading into the Federal Reserve\u2019s next decision on interest rates scheduled for July 25 and July 26, a continuation of the bullish cycle could continue into the end of the year.\nAs the Fed\u2019s decision approaches, with the market expecting the central bank to apply another rate hike, volatility could also increase.\nTraders wishing to play the potential volatility in the stock market can use\u00a0MIAX\u2019s SPIKES\u00a0Volatility products.

Click here for a free trial.\nHere's a\u00a0look at the SPY heading into the second half of 2023.\nThe SPY Chart: The SPY printed a triple top pattern near the $444 level when Friday\u2019s price action is compared to similar price action on June 15 and June 16. The pattern indicates\u00a0a retracement is likely on the horizon and on Friday, the SPY was looking to form an upper wick at that level, which could indicate the pullback will come on Monday.\nThe SPY also has a gap below that exists between $438.28 and $441.11. Gaps on charts are about 90% likely to fill and if the ETF falls over the next few trading days, the SPY may find support at the lower range of the gap.\nThe SPY\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) is measuring in at about 67%, which is edging toward overbought territory. It should be noted, however, that stocks and ETFs can remain over-extended to the upside and the downside for long periods of time.\nIf the SPY can close the trading session near its high-of-day and over the $444 mark, the triple top pattern will be negated and the ETF could spike higher on Monday.\nThe SPY has resistance above at $447.06 and $454.05 and support below at $436.79 and $429.80.\nRead Next:\u00a0Top Stories Friday, June 30: Amazon Hires Dozens of Former FTC Officials, Volkswagen Discusses With Tesla to Adopt North American Charging Standard, FDA Approves First Hemophilia A BioMarin Gene Therapy\nPhoto:\u00a0Mohamed Hassan\u00a0from\u00a0Pixabay\n",

      "title": "Why This Tesla Analyst Is Shooting For Below-Consensus Q2 Deliveries",
      "body": "Electric vehicle pioneer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is widely expected to report its second-quarter deliveries on Sunday. An analyst at RBC Capital Markets expects quarterly deliveries to come in below the consensus estimate.\nThe Tesla Analyst: Tom Narayan has an Outperform rating and $305 price target for Tesla stock.\nThe Tesla Thesis\nQ2 Expectation: Tesla's total second-quarter deliveries will likely come in at 438,000 units, Narayan said, citing his checks of regionally reported data and app download data. The estimated number would mark a 72% year-over-year increase and a 4% sequential estimate.\nThis compares to the company-compiled consensus estimate of 446,823 units. Future Fund's Gary Black said he expects second-quarter deliveries of 450,000 units, compared to FactSet's estimate of 445,000 units. China sales, according to the fund manager, would come in at 150,000 units.\nRBC\u2019s Region-Wise Forecast\nGeographyDeliveries (in units)U.S.168,000China158,000Europe67,000Rest of the World45,000\nRBC\u2019s Model-Wise Forecast\nModelsDeliveries (in units)Model 3/Y423,000Model S/X15,000\nSee Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock\nPremises Behind The Number\nRBC's Narayan noted that total global Tesla app downloads continued to trend higher, which points to an increase in sales. China production and sales are improving, but domestic monthly sales remain choppy, making an accurate prediction difficult, he said.\nEuropean sales were following normal quarterly trends and app download data supported robust June deliveries, Narayan said. But the analyst said he remains a bit more cautious regarding the region's performance.\nDespite RBC's below-consensus second-quarter forecast, Narayan sees Tesla remaining on track to achieve its 1.8 million-unit sales target for 2023. Demand is picking up following price cuts announced earlier this year, he added.\nWhat's Next: Following the second-quarter deliveries update, market focus will likely turn to the earnings for the quarter, Narayan said. Investors will be closely monitoring several key metrics, including trends in demand, the company\u2019s financial health with an emphasis on operating margin, advancements in Tesla\u2019s full-self driving software, and the status of its recent partnerships with other industry players in the charging network sector.\nTesla Price Action: Tesla stock rose 1.66% to close at $261.77 on Friday, according to Benzinga Pro data. The stock has gained about 114% so far this year.\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.\nRead Next: Want Your Tesla Cybertruck In Black Matte Or Blue Satin?

The justices are also set to consider the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s funding system and whether to overturn a precedent that gives agencies discretion when interpreting ambiguous congressional directives.\n5th Circuit's Decision\nThe 5th Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, stated that Congress violated the Seventh Amendment, which safeguards the right to a jury trial in civil lawsuits, by allowing the SEC to request an administrative law judge to impose penalties instead of going to federal court. The 5th Circuit also opined that Congress provided the commission with excessive discretion to determine which cases will be heard by its in-house judges.\nAlso Read:\u00a0Supreme Court Strikes Down Biden's Student Debt Relief: Stocks To Watch\nThe Case of George Jarkesy\nThe decision originated from an SEC complaint against George Jarkesy, a hedge fund manager accused in 2013 of misleading investors about the prime broker and auditor of the funds and their investment strategies and holdings. An administrative law judge found Jarkesy guilty of securities fraud, and the SEC eventually ordered him to pay nearly $1 million.\nAdministration Appeal\nU.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the Biden administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, is representing the SEC. She argues that Congress may authorize an agency to handle certain types of cases in-house rather than going to federal court, where the Seventh Amendment jury-trial right would apply.\nNow Read:\u00a0Shaquille O'Neal Built His $400M Net Worth Using This 1 Golden Investing Rule\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n",

      "body": "When in Rome, do the Romans do. But the Romans haven\u2019t fought in the Colosseum for 1,500 years. Could  Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg take their fight there in 2023? What Happened: In the late hours of Thursday, Musk, the CEO of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX, sent Twitter into a frenzy with a tweet, \u201csome chance fight happens in Colosseum,\u201d followed by a second tweet admitting the need to work on his endurance.\nAs if the stakes weren\u2019t high enough already, accompanying the tweet was a video clip from Monty Python\u2019s \u201cLife of Brian,\u201d a comedic take on a Roman gladiator who drops dead of a heart attack before the fight can commence.\nA possibly telling metaphor for Musk\u2019s current predicament?\nThe tweet comes on the heels of a photograph posted by MIT artificial intelligence researcher Lex Fridman showing Musk and himself in a playful sparring session.\nAll of this is in preparation for a potential UFC-style cage fight against Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) co-founder and current CEO.\nYet, according to TMZ, the Italian Ministry of Culture\u2019s Office quelled the Colosseum rumors, \u201cThere has been no formal contact from the ministry nor any written document.\u201d\nSo, the possibility of a fight in the ancient Roman amphitheater is dubious at best, as the ministry said that any challenge in the historical setting must be non-violent.\nTech Titans In The Social Media Arena: The feud between Musk and Zuckerberg isn\u2019t new. It started with the unsuccessful SpaceX launch carrying a Facebook-owned satellite in 2016, according to prior Benzinga reporting. The rivalry now lives in a space where both billionaires own social media platforms, Zuckerberg's Facebook to Musk's Twitter.\nRegardless of whether the fight takes place, the idea already garnered immense publicity for both Musk and Zuckerberg, with Endeavor Group Holdings Inc's (NYSE:EDR) Dana White, who is the UFC CEO, working to build out the event.\nThe Musk-Zuckerberg Showdown, Who Wins? Predicting the outcome is challenging, but Benzinga asked ChatGPT. Zuckerberg, with his white belt in jiu-jitsu, might have a slight upper hand. However, Musk, being physically larger, could use his size to his advantage.\nGiven the odds and the physical training of both individuals, ChatGPT leaned towards Zuckerberg as the more likely winner in a UFC cage fight against Musk.

Zuckerberg: Benzinga Users Favor One Billionaire If Biggest Fight In \u2018History Of The World\u2019 Happens\nBeyond The Brawl, Historical Insight Into The Colosseum: The Roman Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheater, began construction under the emperor Vespasian in around 72 AD and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus.\nThe last recorded games at the Colosseum were held in 523 AD under the reign of Theodoric the Great who was the king of the Ostrogoths and ruler of Italy \u2014 the exact number of fights held per year at the Colosseum isn\u2019t well-documented.\nUse of the Colosseum lessened after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century.\nToday, the Colosseum is mostly used as a tourist attraction, though it has been used for various types of performances. For instance, in 2007, the former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters performed \u201cThe Dark Side of the Moon\u201d live at the Colosseum.\nSpeaking of the darker side, while the exact number of people who died in the Colosseum is unknown, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people and animals died in the Colosseum games.Read Next: Elon Musk Vs.

      "body": "In the current market session, CME Gr Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) price is at $185.29, after a 1.05% increase. However, over the past month, the stock decreased by 0.01%, and in the past year, by 9.33%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. \n\nCME Gr P/E Ratio Analysis in Relation to Industry Peers\nThe P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. \nCME Gr has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 66.44 of the Capital Markets industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. \n\nIn conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. ",

      "title": "Are Musk And Zuckerberg Going To Fight In The Roman Colosseum?",
      "body": "When in Rome, do as the Romans do. But the Romans haven\u2019t fought in the Colosseum for 1,500 years. Could  Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg take their fight there in 2023? What Happened: In the late hours of Thursday, Musk, the CEO of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX, sent Twitter into a frenzy with a tweet, \u201csome chance fight happens in Colosseum,\u201d followed by a second tweet admitting the need to work on his endurance.\nAs if the stakes weren\u2019t high enough already, accompanying the tweet was a video clip from Monty Python\u2019s \u201cLife of Brian,\u201d a comedic take on a Roman gladiator who drops dead of a heart attack before the fight can commence.\nA possibly telling metaphor for Musk\u2019s current predicament?\nThe tweet comes on the heels of a photograph posted by MIT artificial intelligence researcher Lex Fridman showing Musk and himself in a playful sparring session.\nAll of this is in preparation for a potential UFC-style cage fight against Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) co-founder and current CEO.\nYet, according to TMZ, the Italian Ministry of Culture\u2019s Office quelled the Colosseum rumors, \u201cThere has been no formal contact from the ministry nor any written document.\u201d\nSo, the possibility of a fight in the ancient Roman amphitheater is dubious at best, as the ministry said that any challenge in the historical setting must be non-violent.\nTech Titans In The Social Media Arena: The feud between Musk and Zuckerberg isn\u2019t new. It started with the unsuccessful SpaceX launch carrying a Facebook-owned satellite in 2016, according to prior Benzinga reporting. The rivalry now lives in a space where both billionaires own social media platforms, Zuckerberg's Facebook to Musk's Twitter.\nRegardless of whether the fight takes place, the idea already garnered immense publicity for both Musk and Zuckerberg, with Endeavor Group Holdings Inc's (NYSE:EDR) Dana White, who is the UFC CEO, working to build out the event.\nThe Musk-Zuckerberg Showdown, Who Wins? Predicting the outcome is challenging, but Benzinga asked ChatGPT. Zuckerberg, with his white belt in jiu-jitsu, might have a slight upper hand. However, Musk, being physically larger, could use his size to his advantage.\nGiven the odds and the physical training of both individuals, ChatGPT leaned towards Zuckerberg as the more likely winner in a UFC cage fight against Musk.

Zuckerberg: Benzinga Users Favor One Billionaire If Biggest Fight In \u2018History Of The World\u2019 Happens\nBeyond The Brawl, Historical Insight Into The Colosseum: The Roman Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheater, began construction under the emperor Vespasian in around 72 AD and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus.\nThe last recorded games at the Colosseum were held in 523 AD under the reign of Theodoric the Great who was the king of the Ostrogoths and ruler of Italy \u2014 the exact number of fights held per year at the Colosseum isn\u2019t well-documented.\nUse of the Colosseum lessened after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century.\nToday, the Colosseum is mostly used as a tourist attraction, though it has been used for various types of performances. For instance, in 2007, the former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters performed \u201cThe Dark Side of the Moon\u201d live at the Colosseum.\nSpeaking of the darker side, while the exact number of people who died in the Colosseum is unknown, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people and animals died in the Colosseum games.Read Next: Elon Musk Vs.

      "title": "State Street Corporation Announces Preliminary Stress Capital Buffer Requirement And The Intention To Increase Its Quarterly Common Stock Dividend From $0.63 To $0.69 per share",
      "body": "State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) today announced its preliminary stress capital buffer (SCB) requirement, to be maintained at\u00a02.5%, effective October 1, 2023, and the intention to increase its per share common stock dividend by\u00a010%\u00a0to\u00a0$0.69\u00a0in the\u00a0third quarter, subject to consideration and approval by its Board of Directors. It remains the Company's intention to continue common share repurchases under its existing authorization for up to a total of\u00a0$4.5 billion\u00a0in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors.\nState Street's well-positioned balance sheet and strong capital position were highly resilient under the severely adverse economic conditions of the 2023 CCAR exam. State Street's calculated SCB under this year's supervisory stress test was well below the\u00a02.5%\u00a0minimum, preliminarily resulting in a continued SCB at that floor, which maintains our common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio requirement at\u00a08%1.\n\"The latest CCAR results reinforce our strategy and confirm the resiliency and strength of our franchise, which enable us to support our clients and deliver for our shareholders,\" said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ron O'Hanley. \"As we continue to repurchase our stock this year, we are pleased to announce another planned increase to our quarterly common dividend, in line with our goal of returning meaningful capital to our shareholders,\" O'Hanley added.\nState Street's Board of Directors will consider the common stock dividend at a regularly scheduled board meeting in the\u00a0third quarter\u00a0of 2023. State Street's\u00a0third quarter\u00a02023 common stock and other stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount, remain subject to consideration and approval by State Street's Board of Directors at the relevant times.\nStock purchases under State Street's common share repurchase program may be made using various types of transactions, including open-market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction may not be ratable over the duration of the program, may vary from reporting period to reporting period and will depend on several factors, including State Street's capital position and financial performance, investment opportunities, market conditions, the nature and timing of implementation of revisions to the Basel III framework and the amount of common stock issued as part of employee compensation programs. The common share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.\nThe Company also announced today the results of its 2023 annual stress test, with its disclosure available on the Investor Relations section of its website at\u00a0http://investors.statestreet.com.\nConsistent with section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the results of State Street's 2023 annual stress test released today are based on the supervisory severely adverse scenario and incorporate prescribed Dodd-Frank capital actions. State Street, like other institutions covered by the provisions of section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, is required to conduct company-run stress tests annually under its own methodology and to disclose summary results of those company-run stress tests under the severely adverse scenario.\nThis release follows the earlier announcement of the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress test results for covered institutions, including State Street, based on its own methodology. Those results can be found at\u00a0https://www.federalreserve.gov.",

      "body": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was volatile during Friday\u2019s 24-hour trading session, popping up over 2% higher, then\u00a0dropping over 3% lower before settling flat by the afternoon despite Americans showing high interest in the crypto.\nEthereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were showing comparative strength, rising about 4% over Thursday\u2019s closing price.\nWhile the general market has moved higher since June 26, the crypto space has been consolidating mostly sideways after Bitcoin and Ethereum surged over 21% and over 16%, respectively, between June 15 and June 21.\nSince the beginning of 2023, Bitcoin has skyrocketed about 83% and Ethereum has surged 61%. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is trading down about 6% from its Jan. 1 opening price of 7 cents.\nAs the second half of the year begins on Saturday, traders and investors will be watching to see how the apex cryptocurrencies trade over the weekend, which could help to indicate how the stock market will trade after the fourth of July, when most of Wall Street returns to the desk.\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\nThe Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin has been trading in a slight downtrend since June 23, but on Friday, the crypto negated the trend by forming a higher high. If Bitcoin closes the trading day near flat, the crypto will form a doji candlestick, which indicates indecision.\n\nBullish traders want to see Bitcoin trade higher on Saturday to surpass Friday\u2019s high-of-day, which\u00a0would confirm a new uptrend. Bearish traders want to see the bearish double top pattern that Bitcoin formed on June 23 and Friday recognized, which could indicate lower prices are in the cards.\nBitcoin has resistance above at $31,418 and $35.593 and support below at $30,050 and $28,690.\n\nThe Ethereum Chart: Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has also been trading sideways but on Friday, the crypto was attempting to break up from the pattern. If Ethereum closes the 24-hour trading session near its high-of-day, the crypto will form a bullish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come on Saturday.\n\nBullish traders want to see continued momentum on Saturday push the crypto up above $1,950, which would break Ethereum up from the sideways pattern. Bearish traders want to see the stock consolidate sideways and then for big bearish volume to come in and push Ethereum under $1,796, which would be bearish.\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,957 and $2,150 and support below at $1,846 and $1,717.\n\nThe Dogecoin Chart: Dogecoin negated its downtrend on Friday by rising above the most recent lower high, which was formed on Wednesday at $0.065. The crypto was also attempting to print a hammer candlestick, which could indicate higher prices are on the horizon this weekend.\n\nBullish traders want to see Dogecoin break up above a descending trend line, which has been holding the crypto down since June 23. If that happens it could signal a longer-term reversal to the upside. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume drop Dogecoin down under the $0.056 mark, which could indicate a longer-term downtrend on large timeframes.\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.069 and $0.075 and support below at $0.065 and $0.057.\n\nRead Next:\u00a0Melania Trump Takes Another Stab At Digital Art, Releases '1776 Collection' To Commemorate The Fourth Of July\u00a0\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n",

      "title": "Are Musk And Zuckerberg Going To Fight In The Roman Colosseum?",
      "body": "When in Rome, do as the Romans do. But the Romans haven\u2019t fought in the Colosseum for 1,500 years. Could Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg take their fight there in 2023?\n\nWhat Happened: In the late hours of Thursday, Musk, the CEO of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX, sent Twitter into a frenzy with a tweet, \u201csome chance fight happens in Colosseum,\u201d followed by a second tweet admitting the need to work on his endurance.\nAs if the stakes weren\u2019t high enough already, accompanying the tweet was a video clip from Monty Python\u2019s \u201cLife of Brian,\u201d a comedic take on a Roman gladiator who drops dead of a heart attack before the fight can commence.\nA possibly telling metaphor for Musk\u2019s current predicament?\nThe tweet comes on the heels of a photograph posted by MIT artificial intelligence researcher Lex Fridman showing Musk and himself in a playful sparring session.\nAll of this is in preparation for a potential UFC-style cage fight against Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) co-founder and current CEO.\nYet, according to TMZ, the Italian Ministry of Culture\u2019s Office quelled the Colosseum rumors, \u201cThere has been no formal contact from the ministry nor any written document.\u201d\nSo, the possibility of a fight in the ancient Roman amphitheater is dubious at best, as the ministry said that any challenge in the historical setting must be non-violent.\nTech Titans In The Social Media Arena: The feud between Musk and Zuckerberg isn\u2019t new. It started with the unsuccessful SpaceX launch carrying a Facebook-owned satellite in 2016, according to prior Benzinga reporting. The rivalry now lives in a space where both billionaires own social media platforms, Zuckerberg's Facebook to Musk's Twitter.\nRegardless of whether the fight takes place, the idea already garnered immense publicity for both Musk and Zuckerberg, with Endeavor Group Holdings Inc's (NYSE:EDR) Dana White, who is the UFC CEO, working to build out the event.\nThe Musk-Zuckerberg Showdown, Who Wins? Predicting the outcome is challenging, but Benzinga asked ChatGPT. Zuckerberg, with his white belt in jiu-jitsu, might have a slight upper hand. However, Musk, being physically larger, could use his size to his advantage.\nGiven the odds and the physical training of both individuals, ChatGPT leaned towards Zuckerberg as the more likely winner in a UFC cage fight against Musk.\n\nRead Also: Musk Vs. Zuckerberg: Benzinga Users Favor One Billionaire If Biggest Fight In \u2018History Of The World\u2019 Happens\nBeyond The Brawl, Historical Insight Into The Colosseum: The Roman Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheater, began construction under the emperor Vespasian in around 72 AD and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus.\nThe last recorded games at the Colosseum were held in 523 AD under the reign of Theodoric the Great who was the king of the Ostrogoths and ruler of Italy \u2014 the exact number of fights held per year at the Colosseum isn\u2019t well-documented.\nUse of the Colosseum lessened after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century.\nToday, the Colosseum is mostly used as a tourist attraction, though it has been used for various types of performances. For instance, in 2007, the former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters performed \u201cThe Dark Side of the Moon\u201d live at the Colosseum.\nSpeaking of the darker side, while the exact number of people who died in the Colosseum is unknown, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people and animals died in the Colosseum games.\n\nRead Next: Elon Musk Vs.

      "body": "In the midst of Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) highly-anticipated second-quarter delivery report, Elon Musk's warning to shareholders has echoed loudly, as he cautioned them to navigate the treacherous waters of \"margin loans\" and market mania with utmost care.\u00a0\nWhat Happened: Tesla is widely expected to report its second-quarter deliveries on Sunday. Now, amid the fervor surrounding Tesla\u2019s performance, Musk has taken to Twitter to caution the company's shareholders.\u00a0\nSee Also: Tesla Nearly Sells Out Inventory In This Country As Monumental Q2 Looks More Inevitable\nIn response to a post by a Tesla influencer, Whole Mars Catalog, who expressed intentions to increase their stake in the company, Musk advised shareholders to be wary of margin loans.\u00a0\nWhile the tech billionaire highlighted Tesla\u2019s historically high stock variability and emphasized the company\u2019s confidence in long-term value creation, he also acknowledged the uncontrollable nature of the manic-depressive stock market, calling for caution among shareholders.\n\nMusk's cautious advice has generated significant interest and speculation within the Tesla community. Although, it is pertinent to note here that this isn't the first time the Tesla CEO has commented on stock market volatility.\u00a0\nAn analyst at RBC Capital Markets also expects lower-than-expected delivery results for the second quarter.\u00a0\nEarlier this week, Cathie Wood-led ARK Invest Management sold nearly $7.3 million worth of Tesla stocks.\u00a0\nWhy It's Important: For the unversed, \"margin loans\" are loans that investors take out against their existing investments, using those investments as collateral.\u00a0\nThey can be risky because if the value of the collateral (in this case, Tesla stock) declines significantly, it would require the investor to provide additional funds or sell the stock to repay the loan.\u00a0\nMusk\u2019s advice is a reminder that Tesla\u2019s stock has historically exhibited high variability, meaning its price can fluctuate significantly without clear reasons or patterns. This volatility can make margin loans particularly risky.\nRead Next: Why This Tesla Analyst Is Shooting For Below-Consensus Q2 Deliveries",

      "body": "Former President Donald Trump on Friday berated Joe Biden for the incumbent president's failed student loan forgiveness plan.\nWhat Happened: Trump, while addressing the crowd at the Moms for Liberty Joyful Warriors National Summit in Philadelphia, called Biden \u201ccrooked\u201d as he celebrated a favorable Supreme Court decision in Biden vs. Arkansas.\u00a0\nIn his Philadelphia speech, he vehemently criticized Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness proposal, which aimed to forgive more than $10,000 for each federal loan borrower. \u201c[It] would have been very unfair to the millions and millions of people who paid their debt through hard work and diligence,\u201d Trump said. \u201cVery unfair.\u201d\nSee Also: Biden Brushes Off Low Approval Ratings Amid Re-Election Bid: \u2018They Were The Same Way When I Ran And Won\u2019 In 2020\n\u201cWe have a corrupt president.

The robot can work continuously for 12 to 14 hours, powered by a lithium iron phosphate battery pack and flexible solar panels.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) shares just ahead of the electric vehicle maker's second-quarter deliveries report.\nWhat Happened: On Friday, Wood's Ark Invest, through its Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) and Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW), sold 72,183 Tesla shares, valued at about $18.9 million.\nArk has been a seller of Tesla stock in the recent past, as the stock continued to grind higher. The fund's net buying so far this year is positive with a tally of 1.193 billion purchases and 876,382 sale transactions.\nFor the week, Ark sold 108,805 Tesla shares in three sessions, likely pocketing proceeds of $28.2 million.\nSee Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock\nWhy It's Important: Tesla is widely expected to announce its second-quarter deliveries on Sunday.

      "body": "Japan is reportedly considering the purchase of Starlink satellite systems from Elon Musk\u2018s SpaceX to strengthen its communication capabilities amid escalating tensions over Taiwan.\nWhat Happened: The Starlink system, which has been a critical communications system for the Ukrainian military, could buy more time in a conflict over Taiwan, according to a report in the South China Morning Post.\nThe move comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping intensifies military pressure on Taiwan, with at least 11 Chinese aircraft crossing the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial barrier between the two sides, on Friday. Taiwan\u2019s defense ministry reported 24 Chinese warplanes, including fighter jets and bombers, near Taiwan on Friday morning.\nWhy It Matters: The potential purchase of Starlink systems by Japan is significant in the context of escalating tensions between China and Taiwan. As Benzinga reported, Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Minister Jaushieh Joseph Wu warned that Xi\u2019s threat against Taiwan is much more serious than what is visible. He urged all democratic nations to collaboratively address China's expansionist ambitions and its assertive military actions.\nSee Also: Biden Praises Blinken\u2019s China Efforts After He Told Xi Jinping US Does Not Support Taiwan Independence\nEarlier, Benzinga reported that Xi is reportedly setting a timeline for the annexation of Taiwan, a move that could potentially escalate tensions in the region. The Starlink system could provide Taiwan and its allies with a crucial communication advantage in the event of a conflict.\nMoreover, Taiwan has been inspired by Starlink\u2019s role in the Ukraine war to establish its satellite communications provider to brace itself against a potential assault from China, as Benzinga reported earlier this year.\nRead Next: Another Taiwan Ally Could Pivot To China: Guatemala Presidential Hopeful Arevalo Eyes Closer Ties With Xi Jinping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Hi, I am the Benzinga Newsbot! \n      I wrote the above article, utilizing the sources I hyperlinked above.\n\n       This story was reviewed by Benzinga editors in line with the publication\u2019s editorial guidelines before being published. \n\n\n",

However, visitors to the site are now greeted with an unexpected login prompt, effectively blocking their access unless they possessed a registered profile.\u00a0\nSee Also: Elon Musk Wants To Make Twitter Creator-Friendly With An Ambitious Feature That Seems Unreal\nMusk later attributed the decision to a need for improved performance on the platform.

He referred to the blockade as a \u201ctemporary emergency measure\u201d implemented to counter the rampant data pilfering.\n\nTemporary emergency measure.

Musk vowed to take legal action against those responsible for stealing Twitter\u2019s data, eagerly anticipating their appearance in court, albeit possibly two to three years down the line.\n\nSeveral hundred organizations (maybe more) were scraping Twitter data extremely aggressively, to the point where it was affecting the real user experience.

As Benzinga reported, Novo Nordisk announced promising weight-loss results from a late-stage trial of a high-dose oral drug semaglutide, leading to an average weight loss of 15.1% in overweight or obese adults.\nSee Also: Ozempic Overshadowed As Eli Lilly\u2019s Retatrutide Promises Unprecedented Weight Loss\nHowever, the convenience of a pill form may not outweigh the potential for misuse and the inconvenience of the required daily routine. Furthermore, the pill form of the drug could be easier to abuse, with easy access for people with eating disorders, as Benzinga reported.\nDespite the potential for weight loss, the ultimate goal should be overall health. The weight-loss drugs alone do not guarantee good health, and exercise and nutrition still matter. Rapid weight loss can lead to loss of lean muscle mass, making strength training especially important. A balanced diet is also necessary to provide nutrients and fuel the body.\nRead Next: This New Drug May Be Even Stronger Than Ozempic For Weight Loss, Clinical Trial Shows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Hi, I am the Benzinga Newsbot! \n      I wrote the above article, utilizing the sources I hyperlinked above.\n\n       This story was reviewed by Benzinga editors in line with the publication\u2019s editorial guidelines before being published. \n\n\n",

      "body": "Amid a series of high-profile legal battles, media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2018s Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:FOX) has settled a $12-million gender discrimination lawsuit, further deepening the scandal surrounding the empire.\nWhat Happened: Fox News has reached a staggering $12 million settlement in a gender discrimination lawsuit, intensifying the ongoing scandal surrounding the news network, reported Reuters.\u00a0\nThe settlement comes after multiple legal battles, including a high-profile defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems, which saw Fox News pay $787.5 million.\nSee Also: Trump Lashes Out At Fox News, Rupert Murdoch, Says \u2018Time To Get Rid Of Fake News\u2019\nSettlement Details\nFormer Fox News producer Abby Grossberg, the plaintiff in the gender discrimination lawsuit, alleged that she faced gender-based discrimination and accused the network\u2019s lawyers of pressuring her to make misleading statements during the Dominion Voting Systems case. The settlement represents a substantial sum agreed upon by both parties to avoid further litigation.\nGrossberg\u2019s Allegations\nGrossberg, who served as the head of booking guests for conservative host Tucker Carlson, claimed to have experienced a hostile and discriminatory work environment at Fox News. Among her accusations were gender and religious discrimination, as well as pay equity violations, the report noted.\u00a0\nTies To Dominion Voting Systems Case\nThe gender discrimination lawsuit unfolded against the backdrop of the high-stakes legal battle between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems. In the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion, Fox News had to settle for a hefty sum of $787.5 million. Grossberg\u2019s involvement as a potential key witness in the Dominion case raised the stakes further.\nFollowing the settlement, Grossberg expressed her satisfaction with the outcome, stating, \u201cWhile I stand by my publicly filed claims and allegations, in light of today\u2019s settlement of $12 million, pursuant to which I have now withdrawn those claims, I am heartened that Fox News has taken me and my legal claims seriously.\"\nWhy It's Important: In April this year, Fox News announced the departure of Carlson, the conservative host accused of allowing debunked election-fraud claims about Dominion Voting Systems to air on his show, while privately expressing doubts about the credibility of those claims.\nHe later announced plans for a new Twitter show and voiced criticism of news journalism in a video.\nRead Next: The Gritty Details Of Fox News\u2019 Murdoch Succession: \u2018He Pitted His Kids Against Each Other\u2019",

This decision comes after the recent handover of control from George to his son, Alex Soros.\nSignificant Changes Ahead\nAccording to a spokesperson, the board of the charity has approved \u201csignificant changes\u201d to its operating model, including a substantial reduction in global headcount.

      "body": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reportedly embarked on a covert visit to an amusement park in Pyongyang to indulge in some of its rides in 2018, just a day after a high-stakes meeting with top U.S. diplomat, Mike Pompeo, according to a new state-produced propaganda vlog.\nWhat Happened: Amid a veil of secrecy, Kim embarked on a remarkable escapade, venturing to a theme park merely a day after his meeting with Pompeo in Pyongyang, reported NK News. Pompeo then served as a Secretary of State in former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\nSee also: AI \u2018Weighs\u2019 In On Kim Jong Un\u2019s Health Secrets: Spoiler, He\u2019s Big\nSurprisingly, state media made no mention of the amusement park visit, focusing solely on Kim\u2019s meeting with Pompeo. It wasn\u2019t until Oct. 11, 2022, that the media divulged further details about the North Korean leader's activities in the capital, leaving his amusement park visit shrouded in secrecy.\u00a0\nCuriously, historical evidence suggests that this wasn\u2019t the first time Kim covertly enjoyed amusement park rides, with documented instances on April 25, 2010, before assuming leadership, and Nov. 2, 2015.\nKim Jong Un\u2019s predilection for unconventional pursuits extends beyond amusement parks. Notably, he visited Pyongyang\u2019s Mirae Shop department store a day before departing for Singapore to meet then President Donald Trump in June 2018, the report noted.\u00a0\nWhy It's Important: For the unversed, in 2018, Trump formed an unlikely friendship with Kim Jong Un, which he continues to boast about to this day. Their relationship took an extraordinary turn when Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to step foot into North Korea during a historic meeting at the demilitarized zone.\u00a0\nThe encounter was hailed as a significant step towards denuclearization and easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Despite subsequent challenges and setbacks in achieving complete denuclearization, Trump frequently references his friendship with Kim Jong Un as a testament to his unique approach to diplomacy.\nRead Next: North Koreans Urge Kim Jong Un For \u2018War Of Revenge\u2019 To Destroy US: \u2018Mainland Is Within Our Shooting Range\u2019",

The nation's highest court Friday, by a 6-3 decision, invalidated President Joe Biden's student debt relief plan that would have canceled $430 billion in student loan debt.\nNot to be cowed down, President Biden announced a few initiatives meant as an antidote to the SCOTUS move. \nWhat Happened: Venting his frustration, Biden tweeted, \"Hope was on the horizon thanks to our relief plan, and today's decision snatches it away.\"\n\"But I won't stop fighting for borrowers.\"\nThe president also slammed the Republicans who voted to overturn the student loan relief, adding that they benefited from thousands in pandemic relief loans to keep their own businesses open. These loans were forgiven, he added.\n\"Now, they refuse to extend the same relief to borrowers with student debt,\" Biden said.\nSee Also: Biden Unveils Vision For Economic Growth: Shifting From Trickle-Down To \u2018Bidenomics\u2019\nBiden Resolute: The president said his administration will use every tool at its disposal to get the people student debt relief. He also said his administration was moving fast with a new way forward.\nPresident Biden unveiled a comprehensive plan to address the issue of student debt, outlining a two-step resolution. The first step involves the development of a new pathway aimed at delivering swift relief to a broad range of borrowers. Emphasizing the urgency of the matter, Biden highlighted that Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona has already taken the first official action required to implement this plan.\nThe president was referring to the launch of regulatory rulemaking process by the Education Department but this will likely take months.\nSecondly, the president said his administration was \"creating a temporary 12-month \u2018on-ramp\u2019 to repayment.\"\n\"This is not the same as the student loan pause, but during this period \u2014 if you miss payments \u2014 this \"on ramp\" will temporarily remove the threat of default or having your credit harmed.\"\n\"This fight isn't over,\" Biden said.\nRead Next: How To Invest In Startups",

One skeptic YouTuber, however, isn\u2019t buying it.\nWhat Happened: A video of MrBeast, the content creator known for his jaw-dropping stunts and massive giveaways, has been making rounds on social media, in which he stated that he could start a brand new YouTube channel, devoid of his face or voice, and gather a staggering 20 million subscribers within a mere six months.\u00a0\nWhile this audacious declaration may have left many awestruck, one skeptical YouTuber is raising doubts about the feasibility of MrBeast\u2019s ambitious goal.\nSee Also: MrBeast Embodies His Creator Name: Prepare To Be Shocked By The YouTuber\u2019s Physical Transformation\nThe YouTuber, who goes by the name Armaani and has 3.5 million subscribers, took to Twitter and asked netizens if anyone was buying MrBeast's statement about starting a channel from scratch without any affiliation and gaining 20 million subscribers within six months.\u00a0\nHe further challenged MrBeast, saying that if Donaldson pulls this off \"without anyone knowing,\" he will donate $20,000 to charity and work for the said channel completely free for a year.\u00a0\n\nIf @MrBeast secretly pulls this off without anyone knowing, I'll personally donate $20,000 to charity and work for that said channel for a year for FREE.

      "body": "Love knows no bounds in the age of artificial intelligence! ChatGPT, the AI-powered bot created by OpenAI, recently stole the spotlight by officiating a wedding and blurring the lines between human and machine.\nWhat Happened: Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November, the chatbot has taken on many roles in our lives, from virtual assistants to personal stylists, but now it has added a surprising skill to its repertoire: wedding officiant.\u00a0\nThe couple at the center of this unconventional wedding, Reece Alison Wiench and Deyton Truitt, was able to say their vows with the help of ChatGPT because their state does not require a licensed marriage official to perform the ceremony, reported People Magazine.\u00a0\nSee Also: Check Out These 3 Jaw-Dropping ChatGPT Plugins\u2026 Today!\nIt was the bride\u2019s father, Stephen Wiench, who came up with the idea of using an AI officiant, citing its convenience and cost-effectiveness. However, getting an AI bot to perform the duties of a wedding officiant was not as simple as plugging in a few lines of code.\u00a0\nWhen approached about the idea, ChatGPT initially expressed hesitation, stating, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t do this. I don\u2019t have eyes, I don\u2019t have a body, I can\u2019t show up and officiate your wedding.\u201d \nHowever, the persistent couple, along with their families, fed personal details to the AI bot, allowing it to weave those ideas into the ceremony.\nEventually, ChatGPT rose to the occasion and became an integral part of the couple\u2019s special day. Positioned between the bride and groom, a speaker with a robotic, C-3PO-like mask projected the bot\u2019s voice, uttering words that would unite the couple in matrimony, the report noted.\u00a0\nWhy It's Important: While in this particular incident, the use of ChatGPT worked well for the people involved, it is possible that the same might not be the end result for others.\u00a0\nPreviously, it was reported that two New York lawyers were slapped with a $5,000 fine after they unwittingly fell victim to the creative legal research capabilities of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\u00a0\nGenerative AI models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing AI and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Bard have gained notoriety for their tendency to produce fabricated information confidently, a phenomenon commonly referred to as \"hallucinations.\"\nTherefore, it is important to remember that while ChatGPT is a fairly advanced technology, there are still certain aspects that users need to be aware and cautious about.\u00a0\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\u00a0\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How To Become A Twitter Wiz Using ChatGPT",

      "title": "Amazon's New Palm Scanning Technology Lets You Buy Alcohol With A Simple Hand Swipe",
      "body": "Amazon.com Inc. is introducing an exciting new feature to its palm-based payment system, making it a breeze for users to purchase alcohol with a swipe of their hand. Known as Amazon One, this innovative system allows people to conveniently pay for their items by placing their palms over a scanning device.\u00a0\nTo ensure a seamless alcohol purchase, users are required to upload their government-issued ID on the Amazon One website. Amazon has made it clear that it doesn\u2019t store user IDs, and the documentation is securely verified by a trusted third-party provider.\nWhen it comes to age verification, bartenders will have the tools they need with Amazon One. By using the device, they can easily confirm whether a user is of legal drinking age through a prominent \u201c21+\u201d message displayed on the screen. Bartenders will also perform a \u201cvisual match\u201d by comparing the user\u2019s appearance with a photo uploaded by the user.\nTo stay updated with top startup news & investments,\u00a0sign up for Benzinga's Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter.\nAmazon initially introduced its palm-swiping technology to enhance customers\u2019 shopping experiences, emphasizing speed and efficiency. Since its launch back in 2020, Amazon One has been successfully implemented in select Fresh markets, Go convenience stores and some Whole Foods Market Inc. locations. The technology has also found its way into sports and entertainment venues, and Panera Bread recently began testing Amazon One at two of its restaurants.\nThe Coors Field baseball stadium in Denver will be among the first venues to offer the convenience of Amazon One for purchasing alcohol, adding to the overall enjoyment of attendees.\nWhile some concerns have been raised by privacy advocates regarding payment systems using biometric data, Amazon assures users that palm recognition is a more privacy-conscious approach. Unlike other biometric systems, it\u2019s not possible to determine a person\u2019s identity simply by looking at an image of their palm, according to Amazon.\nSee more on\u00a0startup investing\u00a0from Benzinga.\n\n\u00a0AI Startups Turn to Retail Investors To Fund the Growth of the $1.59 Trillion Artificial Intelligence Market\nBe An Owner, Not Just A Consumer: Retail Investors Are Taking Stakes In Their Favorite Startups To Own The Upside\n",

      "title": "DeSantis On Whether He Has Been Disloyal To Trump: 'Politicians Have To Earn Support'",
      "body": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis this week responded to former President Donald Trump\u2019s allegations of disloyalty, stating that politicians have to \u201cearn support\u201d and are not entitled to it.\nWhat Happened: DeSantis\u2019 comments came during an appearance on Fox News, where he addressed Trump\u2019s claims that the Florida governor is betraying him by mounting a presidential campaign of his own, The Independent reports. \nDeSantis, who currently trails the former president by a wide margin in most polls of likely GOP primary voters, emphasized that no politician \u2014 even a former president such as Trump \u2014 is entitled to support from anyone.\n\"Disloyal to who?\" Desantis reportedly said when asked if he \u201cfeels\u201d he has been \u201cdisloyal\u201d to the former president as alleged. \"Politicians have to earn support \u2014 they're not entitled to support,\"\u00a0he added, according to the Independent, saying he had been \u201chappy\u201d to do a lot for Trump during 2016 and 2020 campaigns.\nSee Also: Ron DeSantis Proposes Eliminating IRS And Several Federal Departments In Push Against \u2018Woke Ideology\u2019\nWhy It Matters: This exchange between DeSantis and Trump is significant as it highlights the growing tension between the two prominent Republican figures. \nTrump had previously expressed his dismay over DeSantis joining the presidential race, branding the Florida leader as disloyal for running against him, as reported by Benzinga. \nDespite these criticisms, DeSantis remains confident that his lead over Trump will grow in the second half of 2023, as he continues to gain support and recognition within the Republican party.\nDeSantis\u2019 financial success has also been a topic of discussion this week. A state financial disclosure filed on Friday revealed that the Florida Governor made $1.25 million from a book deal, significantly increasing his net worth to $1.17 million by the end of 2022.\nRelated: Trump\u2019s GOP Grip, North Korea\u2019s Revenge Call And Backlash For DeSantis: A Turbulent Week In Politics",

      "title": "Trump's Niece Says Her Uncle 'Always Commits Crimes That Are The Nature Of Which Protect Him.' Did The Ex-President Intentionally Release An Audio Tape Discussing Classified Documents?",
      "body": "An audio tape released by CNN of former President Donald Trump discussing classified documents in a 2021 meeting in Bedminster, New Jersey, created a furor this week. Donald Trump's niece Mary Trump recently delved into the implications of the development.\nIn the latest episode of the \u201cMary Trump Show\u201d podcast that aired on Tuesday, the former president's niece and her guest Jen Taub weighed in on rumors that Donald Trump intentionally released the audio tape of himself committing treason.\nTrump\u2019s Proactive Move? Taub, a law professor, said that she saw Donald Trump say on his Truth Social platform that the audio tape would exonerate him. She also explained the motive behind the tape\u2019s circulation, noting that one of the questions that a judge typically asks a jury is whether it knows about a case. Because of the widespread publicity the tape has already attracted, the former president\u2019s lawyers could argue that the jury in Trump\u2019s case has already formed an opinion.\n\u201cYou listen to that and you form an opinion. So you\u2019re only going to get people on the jury who either lie and say they haven\u2019t formed an opinion, or people who are just so out of it, and that\u2019s just not a great jury pool,\u201d Taub said.\n\"You want people \u2026 who say you I haven\u2019t heard that much about this or even if I have I\u2019m not going to be biased well,\" she added.\nTaub reasoned that the circulation of the tape could be a ploy. \u201cIf the jury already heard this, you have already made up its mind,\u201d she said. \nSee Also: Trump\u2019s Niece Reveals Why Ivanka, Jared Kushner Broke Away From Former President: \u2018Every Single Relation In My Family\u2026 Is Transactional\u2019\nSlippery Slope: Mary Trump suggested that what matters most in the case is that Donald Trump stole documents that belong to the U.S. government.\n\u201cThey are highly classified. Some of them were human intelligence. We have no idea how many human beings were actually put in danger. People may have died as a result of this. This is treason,\u201d the psychologist said.\nThe fact that Attorney General Merrick Garland is aware of this and the Department of Justice didn't do anything until it heard the tape \u201cshould shake all of us to the core,\u201d she said.\nTaub said that, while special counsel Jack Smith\u2018s move to indict Donald Trump is good news, the bad news is that Aileen Cannon, the Florida district judge assigned to oversee Donald Trump's classified documents case, is doing some \"weird things.\" Cannon objected to the department's desire to keep secret a list of witnesses that Donald Trump isn't allowed to speak with about the case.\nDonald Trump\u2019s trial date is set for Dec. 15. The reason it is not sooner is that \u201cthere\u2019s all this secret information,\u201d Taub said, adding that if he \u201cwere a normal person, he\u2019d be in prison pending the trial.\u201d\nMary Trump added that her uncle always commits crimes \u201cthat are the nature of which protect him.\u201d\nRead Next: How To Invest In Startups\nPhoto: Shutterstock",
