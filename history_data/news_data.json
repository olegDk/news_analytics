The key Apple supplier's move to expand in India reflects the country's growing appeal as an alternative manufacturing destination amid U.S.-China tensions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's incentives to boost local manufacturing have attracted Apple suppliers like Foxconn and Pegatron, which have already set up iPhone assembly facilities in Tamil Nadu. Other states like Karnataka have attracted investments with quick decision-making, reduced bureaucracy, and subsidies. Also, a Foxconn subsidiary forged a deal with Tamil Nadu to set up a components plant with an investment of $195 million, likely to generate\u00a0around 6,000 jobs. Foxconn's decision indicates a potential acceleration of suppliers moving production capacity out of China and aligns with Western investors and corporations looking for alternatives amid regulatory uncertainties in China.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, and AMZN. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: The SPY ETF\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is trading lower as Tuesday's premarket session begins in August. If the sell-off persists, we're watching for it to reach our key downside level of 455.90. Should aggressive selling occur at this level, a lower test of strength at 455.14 is anticipated. Our lowest bear target for the day stands at 454.56. Conversely, if SPY bounces, the bulls must regain control at 456.88. The day's high bull target is 457.86. The Nasdaq ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) is experiencing a sell-off in Tuesday's early session. For bearish traders, continued weakness under 381.89 is key. If selling persists, a test of 380.41 is expected. Should this level break with intense selling, the low bear target is 378.93. If buyers emerge, a reclaim of 381.89 is the first upside target, followed by 382.93. If bulls dominate, a test of 384.36 could occur, with an ultimate bull target of 385.55. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0continues its recent trend, fluctuating between 195.67 and 196.61. If the lower level breaks, a lower test at 195.25 is expected. Aggressive selling could push it to a daily low target of 194.29. On the bullish side, if 196.61 holds, the stock could move up to 196.94, with a high bull target of 198.22. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is hovering just above the key level of 333.46. Weak trading that breaks this level may lead bears to target 331.24, with a daily low target of 328.52. If the level holds and buyers emerge, a move towards 335.96 is possible, with 337.80 in play if buying continues. Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is presently trading just above the key level of 132.94. If aggressive selling occurs here, the bears may target 131.99, with further downside to 131.23 possible. If the level holds, bulls may target 133.86, with the potential for a move up to 134.60.

The apps were all pulled off the shelves from China\u2019s iOS app store on Tuesday, according to data on Chinese mobile app analytics platform Qimai. Spark, an app developed by\u00a0iFlyTek\u00a0that provides ChatGPT-style services, was among the removed apps even though it had a high-profile launch on June 29. Among the other apps pulled was the popular ChatGAi Plus, which provides chatbot, AI translation and writing services and was ranked 9th on the China iOS app store\u2019s paid app chart before being removed on Tuesday afternoon, Qimai records show. In a notification to developers, Apple said that it had removed the apps \u201cbecause they include content that is illegal in China\u201d, citing tighter regulations on deep synthesis technologies and generative AI, according to a screenshot shared by Zhenlu Zuo, a developer behind one of the removed AI apps OpenCat, on X - which was formerly called Twitter.

Apple also urged developers to comply with\u00a0The Administrative Provisions on Deep Synthesis for Internet Information Service, which came into effect in January, including securing a licence from China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), which allows them to offer such services, the screenshot shows. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move comes as\u00a0enthusiasm for generative AI remains high in China\u00a0while Beijing seeks to ramp up scrutiny of the sector. Last month, China issued the world\u2019s earliest and most detailed regulation on generative AI models, drawn up jointly by seven Chinese regulators including the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and the MIIT. The regulation, slated to take effect on August 15, targets all generative AI content services, including text, pictures, audio and video. It requires firms that are hoping to offer their products to the general public to promote healthy content and \u201cadhere to core socialist values\u201d, and to not generate false information or any content that endangers national security. Many providers will also need to pass a security assessment with the CAC before serving the public, according to the new rules, which also require companies to avoid any discrimination based upon ethnicity, faith, country, region, gender, age, occupation and health, in terms of the design of algorithms and the selection of training data. Chinese companies are racing to produce their own answers to Microsoft-backed OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT amid an investment frenzy. During the first half of this year, 22 generative AI start-ups in China received funding, the largest number in the world, AI-focused research firm Zhidongxi said in a report last month. The US was close behind with 21, though American start-ups are better funded than their Chinese peers. But so far no domestic firm has rolled out a major, public facing ChatGPT-style service in China. Some of the most high-profile endeavours by China\u2019s Big Tech firms, including Baidu\u2019s Earnie Bot and Alibaba Group Holding\u2019s Tongyi Qianwen, are either still in trial mode or targeting enterprises only. Ernie Bot is still on Chinese app stores and can be downloaded by any user who has an invitation code to use it.",

                "title": "If You Bet $100 On Lionel Messi To Score In His First 2 MLS Games, Here's How Much You Made",
                "body": "Soccer superstar Lionel Messi joined Inter Miami of the Major League Soccer league in a move that came as a surprise to many. In his first two games playing for Miami, Messi has scored three goals and has one assist. Here\u2019s a look at how bettors have done backing the Argentine\u00a0superstar. What Happened: Messi made his debut for Inter Miami in the Leagues Cup with Inter Miami facing off against Cruz Azul on July 21. In the game, Messi came on as a substitute and scored the game winning goal for Inter Miami, who won 2-1. Messi drew his first start for Inter Miami on July 25 with Inter Miami defeating Atlanta United 4-0. In the game, Messi had two goals and an assist. Bettors who wagered on Messi to score an anytime goal would have cashed bets in both games. Bettors who took their winnings from the first game and rolled them into the second Messi match would have done even better. With odds of -125 to score a goal against Cruz Azul, a $100 bet would have paid out $180, netting a profit of $80 to a bettor. The $180 bet on Messi to score a goal against Atlanta United would have turned the $180 into $330 for a gain of $150, based on odds of -120. A bettor who wagered $100 on Messi to score a goal in both games would now have $330 and be up 230%. Not a bad return for backing a superstar. Related Link: Lionel Messi Impact: Inter Miami Dominating Social Media, Jersey Sales, Tickets And More\u00a0 What\u2019s Next: Messi\u2019s third game is Wednesday, with Inter Miami facing off against Orlando City in the Round of 32 for the Leagues Cup. Inter Miami is favored to win at odds of -155 at DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG). Orlando City is the underdog at odds of +360 and the draw is listed at +310. Messi has odds of a goal or an assist at -370. Bettors can also parlay a Messi goal with Inter Miami winning at odds of +110. Over at BetMGM, odds on Messi to score a goal or multiple goals are offered. Messi getting an anytime goal is offered at odds of -135. Messi to score two goals or more is +400 and Messi to score three goals or more is listed at +1,400. Messi can\u2019t score in every game, but will likely be a favorite in each game until he stops scoring in his Inter Miami matches. To watch the game, you\u2019ll need to have signed up for MLS Season Pass, an offering from AppleTV. Technology giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) landed the exclusive rights to MLS games in a 10-year deal valued at a reported $2.5 billion. The contract began with the 2023 season and came at the perfect time for Apple. Apple participated in the deal that led to Messi's transfer to the MLS. The tech giant is reportedly offering the soccer superstar a portion of the revenue from all new MLS Season Pass subscriptions sold. MLS Season Pass comes with a cost of $14.99 per month, or $12.99 per month for existing AppleTV+ subscribers. There are also full season packages available.

One user stated, \u201cI had a 7 45mm in Starlight and loved it. Planned on matching it to my upcoming 14 ProMax, but they discontinued Starlight for the iPhone 14 ProMax. That burned.

                "body": "This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal. Indian government officials suggested\u00a0Tesla Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0\u2013 currently\u00a0discussing setting up a plant in India\u00a0\u2013 partner with local firms to work with any Chinese suppliers the electric carmaker is currently involved with. What Happened?\u00a0Officials from Tesla told the Indian government that they\u2019d like some of their Chinese suppliers to\u00a0establish operations in India\u00a0to bolster the supply chain. According to sources speaking to Reuters, Indian authorities proposed that Tesla adopt\u00a0Apple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0method, which involved gaining approvals for Chinese suppliers through local joint-venture partners. Direct approval for wholly-owned Chinese companies can prove challenging due to the intense scrutiny they\u2019ve faced since the 2020 border disputes between India and China on their Himalayan border. Why it matters?\u00a0India\u2019s tense relationship with China, following the 2020 border clashes, complicates Tesla\u2019s plans to utilize crucial Chinese suppliers for parts that India lacks locally. This problem isn\u2019t unique to Tesla; even the local\u00a0Tata Motors\u00a0sources battery cells from China. In recent months, the Indian government has accepted some joint-venture partnerships between Chinese suppliers and Indian firms on a case-by-case basis. However, they remain cautious about Chinese companies expanding in India, particularly automakers. Chinese car manufacturer\u00a0BYD\u00a0recently dropped a $1 billion investment plan\u00a0for electric vehicles in India due to stringent scrutiny.

                "body": "iPhone sales are slowing down in the US and South America and flat in China as people wait for the iPhone 15 series to launch in September this year. This could lead to the largest Q3 (September quarter) revenue drop for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since 2016. What Happened: A combination of a weak economy and people holding back their purchases for the iPhone 15 series could lead to the largest fall in September quarter revenue for Apple since 2016, reported Reuters. See Also: iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14: 6 Changes That Will Make The iPhone 15 A Notable Upgrade The September quarter is crucial for Apple since it has traditionally launched new iPhones in September, with some exceptions like the iPhone 12 and iPhone SE series. This usually leads to people waiting for the new iPhone every year in the September quarter. However, this year is expected to be worse, with inflation weighing heavily on people's buying decisions. Deloitte's financial well-being index edged lower in June, reflecting the somber mood. Most of the decline in Apple's topline in the September quarter is expected to come from the Americas \u2013 the region is expected to see a 6% revenue decline. More specifically, iPhone revenue is expected to decline by 2% overall compared to a 3% increase last year and a 1.5% increase in the previous quarter. The iPhone 15 series is expected to feature some important hardware and design upgrades. However, Apple is also reportedly planning to hike the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max prices by $100 each. Here's what we know about the iPhone 15 series so far: Titanium Body: Apple could borrow the titanium body design from the Apple Watch Ultra and use it on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, complete with a brushed finish. USB Type-C Port: Apple is reportedly planning to switch the much-anticipated USB Type-C port with the iPhone 15 series. While this is in response to European Union regulation, it will make it easier to find a charger since most other smartphones sold over the last few years have the same port.\u00a0 Stacked Battery Technology: Apple is said to use stacked battery technology borrowed from electric vehicles. This will help Apple maintain the same size as the iPhone 14 models while increasing battery capacity by up to 20%. Periscope Camera: Apple is rumored to include a periscope camera in its flagship, significantly improving its zooming capabilities. Programmable Action Button: Apple is expected to replace the iconic mute switch with a programmable Action button in the iPhone 15 series. Users will be able to program the button for nine actions, including flashlight, ring/silent or do not disturb modes, low power mode, and more. Dynamic Island On All iPhone 15 Models: After debuting Dynamic Island on the \u2018Pro' models, Apple is now expected to bring it to the non-Pro models as well.

                "body": "Russian hackers reportedly have a new tool that can give full access to all the contents on Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) MacBooks, iMacs and other Mac devices. What Happened: Russian hackers have developed a new tool called Hidden Virtual Network Computer (VNC) that can give attackers complete access to Mac computers, allowing them to steal personal data and login credentials, said cybersecurity firm Guardz. See Also: AI-Based Robot Sings To Piano Player In Japan, Sings About Kim Jong Un's North Korea, NATO \"Guardz CIR team delved into the prominent Russian cybercrime forum \"Exploit.\" Our team discovered another tool available since April 2023, specifically targeting macOS devices owned by small and medium enterprises,\" the firm said. The Hidden VNC tool runs without requesting any permissions and does so silently. It also supports persistence, meaning it can survive reboots and attempts to remove them. It also has a remote file manager that lets attackers steal data without the user noticing it. Russian hackers are demanding $60,000 for a lifetime license to the Hidden VNC tool and a $20,000 add-on that adds even more malicious capabilities. Weaponizing Remote Support Tech: Russian hackers have weaponized a legitimate technology that provides remote technical support. Imagine using software like TeamViewer or AnyDesk to access another computer. Hackers misused this technology for nefarious purposes. When a user is attacked using Hidden VNC, there's nothing that can make them aware of the fact. This makes the attack successful, and the Russian hackers are so confident that they've put $100,000 in an escrow to build trust. The malicious tool also weighs between just 30MB to 100MB, which is very lightweight by today's standards. To remain protected, ensure you are running the latest version of macOS, which is currently 13.4.1. The tool supports macOS Ventura up to version 13.2.

The company said that the apps were pulled \"because they include content that is illegal in China\" in notices issued to affected developers, reported South China Morning Post. See Also: Weak iPhone Demand Could Lead To Apple's Largest Q3 Revenue Drop Since 2016 Some of these apps include Spark from iFlytek, which had a high-profile launch on June 29. Another popular app in the list of purged apps is ChatGAi Plus, which was ranked 9th in the Chinese App Store's paid apps category. This is not the first time Apple has purged its Chinese App Store. Back in 2020, the iPhone maker purged 30,000 apps to comply with regulations on paid content. Of these, games accounted for 90% of the total removals. Earlier in July, Apple removed over 3,000 games to comply with China's gaming regulations. China Tightens Control On AI Services: Apple's decision to purge ChatGPT-like apps is not out of the blue. New regulations passed by the Chinese government with regard to generative AI services and \"deep synthesis technologies\". Essentially, these regulations aim for tighter controls on AI-based services. These regulations are scheduled to go into effect in China on August 15, with an aim to \"promote healthy content\" and \"adhere to core socialist values\". The country issued detailed regulations on generative AI in July. It targets all generative AI content, from text to pictures, audio, and video. With national security in focus, these regulations require firms to use generative AI to ensure that their services are not used to generate false content.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, AMD, and META. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0has recovered from the gap created by the Fitch downgrade and is now trading just beneath the key level of 454.56 as Monday's premarket session unfolds. If bullish action prevails above 454.56, the next target for the bulls will be 455.14. Should this level hold firmly, 455.90 could be the next objective, with a high target of 456.88. If trading remains weak below 454.56, bears may dominate, driving the price down to 453.54. A heavy sell-off through this level could target 452.55, with an ultimate bear target of 451.61. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) have rebounded from the Fitch downgrade and are trading below the key level of 380.41. For bullish traders, overtaking 380.41 will set sights on 381.89, with continued buying potentially leading to 382.93 and a high bull target of 384.36. If weakness persists under 380.41, bears may drive the price down to 378.93. Aggressive selling through this level could target 377.58, with an ultimate low target of 375.18. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) has recovered from the key level of 193.18 to above 194.29. If 194.29 holds, the upside target is 195.25, with potential to reach 195.67. The day's high bull target is 196.61. If bears regain control, 194.29 could be retested. A strong sell-off through this level could lead to 193.82, with further bearish pressure aiming for 193.18 and a low bear target of 192.60. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) has bounced from the key level of 331.24 and is now trading above 333.46. If this level is breached with selling, bears may target 331.24, with a daily low target of 328.52. If 333.46 holds and buyers dominate, a move to 335.96 may occur, with continued buying targeting 337.80. AMD's\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD) earnings report initially lifted the stock, but it then fell with the Fitch downgrade. Trading around 119.93, if this level holds, bulls may target 122.25, with a high target of 125.78. If sellers prevail, bears may target 117.66, with further selling pressure targeting 116.32. The day's low bear target is 113.99. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) is holding above the key level of 317.90. If trading remains strong, the bullish path may lead to 321.03, with a high target of 325.51. Conversely, if bears take over and 317.90 is breached, a move down to 315.70 could ensue. If this key support fails, the price could drop sharply to 311.42. Final Word: With today's session light on data, the market's primary focus will likely be on digesting the Fitch downgrade. Stay alert and trade with care and discipline. Good luck today!

                "body": "Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is trading lower Wednesday along with the broader market after Fitch on Tuesday downgraded the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from AAA, citing fiscal deterioration over the next three years and repeated down-the-wire debt ceiling negotiations. With the downgrade, it becomes the second central rating agency after Standard & Poor's to strip the U.S. of its triple-A rating, Reuters\u00a0reports. Meanwhile,\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD) reported its second-quarter beat and shared its ramp-up plans for its artificial intelligence chips on Tuesday.

The company's revenue fell 17.56% year-over-year but rose 0.94% sequentially to $5.36 billion versus the Street consensus of $4.81 billion. AMD CEO Lisa Su shared plans to ramp up production of its flagship MI300 AI chips in Q4, ready to compete against Nvidia's advanced H100 chips. AMD is also weighing a strategy similar to Nvidia with its MI300 and older MI250 chips to comply with U.S.'s China policy.

ADP\u00a0data shows that the jobs picture continues to be very strong.\u00a0ADP\u00a0employment change came at 324K vs. 185K consensus. ADP\u00a0data runs counter to the momo gurus\u2019 narrative that the Fed will start cutting rates as early as September.\u00a0Momo gurus have used this narrative, in part, to successfully run up the stock market.\u00a0\u00a0 Blind money is the money that flows into Wall Street on the first two days of the month without any analysis and irrespective of stock market conditions.\u00a0Blind money is typically invested in the afternoons.\u00a0Wall Street professionals front run the blind money by buying in the morning and selling to blind money at inflated prices in the afternoon.\u00a0Blind money is helping cushion the drop in the stock market on the credit downgrade. Since the\u00a0AI\u00a0frenzy driven rally has been led by the magnificent seven stocks, it is important for investors to pay attention to the magnificent seven stocks.\u00a0The magnificent seven stocks are Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\u00a0 Today, it is especially important to see how the magnificent seven stocks react to the U.S. downgrade. In the early trade, money is flowing out of Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla.\u00a0Money flows are especially negative in\u00a0TSLA\u00a0in the early trade. In the early trade, money flows are positive in Microsoft\u00a0and Meta. Apple and Amazon will report earnings tomorrow after the market close. Money flows in\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) started the day out by being very negative, but they have turned positive as of this writing. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

In The Arora Report analysis, an important point that no one is talking about is that\u00a0AI\u00a0products from\u00a0AMD\u00a0will dilute its margins.\u00a0Here is the key question for investors: Will the market care about lower margins in view of the expensive valuation of the stock, or will investors look past negatives in excitement over AI?

In The Arora Report analysis,\u00a0buying in gold is nowhere near as strong as would have been expected on the\u00a0U.S. downgrade.\u00a0The reason is the long term interest rates are rising, and gold moves inverse to interest rates in the short term.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is negative.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\u00a0To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0 The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0 If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0 Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "body": "In 2011, when Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States' credit rating from AAA to AA+, the stock market reacted negatively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by over 200 points on the day of the downgrade, and the S&P 500 fell by over 10% in the following month.

Here are some strategies that traders could use to profit from the news: Trading SPY (NYSE:SPY), QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ), and IWM (NYSE:IWM) are an easy way to trade the market lower.\u00a0\u00a0 These Popular Stock Tickers did poorly in 2011 after the downgrade in bonds and may have a repeat performance today.

                "title": "Apple Analysts Upbeat Ahead Of Tech Giant's Q3 Print: Why Earnings Could Be Positive Catalyst Driving Stock Higher",
                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are getting hammered Wednesday as they get caught in the maelstrom of the weakness induced by Fitch's downgrade of the sovereign rating of the U.S. The sell-off comes just ahead of the company's fiscal year third-quarter earnings release date. Cupertino is scheduled to release its quarterly results Thursday after the market close. Key Q3 Estimates: Apple is expected to report third-quarter earnings per share of $1.09 per share versus the $1.20 per share it reported a year ago. The consensus revenue estimate models a 10.50% year-over-year decline to $74.24 billion. Analysts' Take: Ahead of the earnings report JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee reiterated an Overweight rating. As the analyst shifted his investment timeframe from 2023 to 2024, he issued a 2024 price target of $235, up from his 2023 price target of $190. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating and a 12-month price target of $220. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring has an Overweight rating and a $220 price target. The tech giant is the firm's top pick. Apple An Earnings Compounder, JPMorgan Says: \u201cWe see Apple well positioned to drive higher confidence from the upcoming earnings print as an \u2018earnings compounder\u2019 that continues to drive resilient performance,\u201d said Chatterjee in a note. As Apple moves away from the revenue declines that started in the December quarter of 2022 to potentially growing revenue in the September quarter of 2023, investors will likely be further convinced of the replacement cycle drivers for hardware products and diversified growth drivers in Services, the analyst said. JPMorgan expects Apple to report above-consensus June quarter earnings per share and revenue of $1.23 and $81.9 billion, respectively. The upside will likely come from strength in iPhone, Mac and Services businesses, the analyst added. Chatterjee also forecasts above-consensus September quarter guidance from the company, thanks to improving Chinese demand, ad revenue rebound for the Services segment and moderating forex headwinds. The analyst estimates revenue of $91.9 billion for the quarter. See Also: Best Technology Stocks Right Now Brace For In-Line To Above iPhone Revenue, Says Wedbush: Analyst Ives said his China checks suggest Apple could post at least in-line to above-consensus iPhone revenue for the September quarter. The company may have benefited from a higher average selling price and increased iPhone 14 upgrade activity, he said. This coupled with an uptick in Services revenue should keep Apple on track for at least an in-line quarter, Ives said. Morgan Stanley Markedly Upbeat About September Quarter: \u00a0Analyst Woodring sees a setup for Apple where numbers will begin to move materially higher. The company will likely post an in-line June quarter and guide September quarter revenue and gross margin materially higher than the consensus, the analyst said. He based his optimism on stable iPhone builds, seasonal Mac strength, low-teens Services growth, and continued secular and cyclical margin tailwinds. \u201cImportantly, this creates a setup where we expect positive estimates revisions post-earnings, after 5 consecutive quarters of Apple guiding forward quarter estimates below consensus,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cAs a result, we see earnings next Thursday as a positive stock catalyst that can help Apple shares re-rate towards our unchanged $220 price target,\u201d he added. The analyst calls for a double-digit year-over-year decline in iPhone and iPad revenue in the June quarter due to cycle dynamics and tougher comparisons. Mac revenue may have grown 4% and Services revenue is likely to have increased by 8.8%, thanks to 6% App Store growth, he added. Apple Price Action: At last check, Apple shares were down 1.63% to $192.44, according to Benzinga Pro data.

                "body": "Elon Musk\u00a0intends to take a stand and seeks a conversation with\u00a0Tim Cook\u00a0over the\u00a0tech giant\u2019s revenue-sharing arrangement\u00a0with the microblogging site, while the\u00a0Dogecoin\u00a0(CRYPTO: DOGE) co-creator adds fuel to the fire, urging\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO to share the wealth with creators on\u00a0Twitter, now rebranded as \u201cX.\u201d\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0On Wednesday, Musk shared his intention to speak to Apple CEO regarding the implications of the tech\u00a0giant\u2019s current 30% revenue-sharing policy. The tech billionaire said he would talk with Cook about possibly adjusting the fee to 30% of what \u201cX\u201d keeps.\u00a0\u00a0 The move aims to maximize \u201cwhat creators receive\u201d on the platform.\u00a0\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0Apple CEO Tim Cook Finds Clarity Using This Strategy: It\u2019s A \u2018Palate Cleanser For The Mind\u2019 Dogecoin co-creator\u00a0Billy Markus, also known as\u00a0Shibetoshi Nakamoto\u00a0on \u201cX,\u201d joined the conversation and urged Cook to share more wealth with creators, saying Apple has plenty of money that the company can share with creators. Musk further said that while the microblogging site had initially said they\u2019d keep nothing for the first year and only 10% after that period, they now promise to keep no percentage until payouts go beyond $100,000. After that also, they\u2019ll take 10%.\u00a0 yeah tim apple has enough money! give more to us tim! In response to another post, Musk also revealed that a new feature is on the horizon, allowing creators to adjust the price of paid subscriptions. Yeah, that's coming soon Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0There has been a\u00a0longstanding conflict\u00a0concerning the 30% commission Cupertino levies from companies to sell their products and services on the App Store and the\u00a0regulations it imposes\u00a0on such apps. According to Apple, its payment system safeguards users against fraudulent activities, thereby ensuring the\u00a0App Store\u00a0is a secure platform for use.

What Happened:\u00a0During the 2022 NBA All-Star Weekend, Antetokounmpo, the star athlete who is a member of the\u00a0Milwaukee Bucks, made an innocent move that sparked an unexpected social media frenzy.\u00a0 While capturing the moments of the event with his Google Pixel, little did he know that he was about to become the subject of trolling on the mean streets of Twitter, now rebranded as \u201cX.\u201d\u00a0 The Twitterverse, accustomed to seeing millionaire athletes flaunting their iPhones, pounced on the opportunity to mock Antetokounmpo for his choice of a Google Pixel.

Last year, it was reported that the popularity of iPhones among smartphone users was\u00a0reportedly worrying Google\u00a0to such an extent that the tech giant decided to double down on its hardware, including its Pixel phones.

                "body": "Apple, Inc.\u2018s (NASDAQ:AAPL) foray into financial services has apparently proved fruitful, adding to the momentum the overall Services business is seeing. What Happened: Apple disclosed Wednesday, the high-yielding savings account it is offering to Apple Card customers has received over $10 billion in deposits. The service offered in collaboration with Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was launched in April. Just after the launch, reports suggested the account drew in over $1 billion in deposits within four days. The savings account promises a yield of 4.15% even when financial services giants pay literally no interest for the deposits their clients park with them. It also provides Apple Card users an opportunity to grow their daily cash rewards. \"With each of the financial products we've introduced, we've sought to reinvent the category with our users' financial health in mind\u2026it remained our guiding principle with the launch of Savings,\" said Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. Apple said since the launch of the savings account, 97% of savings customers have chosen to have their daily cash automatically deposited into their account. Savings account holders can also deposit additional funds into the account through a linked bank account from their Apple cash balance, it added. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock Why It's Important: The announcement comes even as reports suggested in July that Goldman is in talks to offload the Apple Card and savings account portfolio as the latter strives to scale down its consumer lending business. Goldman also collaborates with Apple for its \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later' service the tech giant launched in March. A Wall Street Journal report said in early June that Apple savings account holders are scrambling to close down their accounts due to difficulty in the withdrawal of funds. Apple's financial services business is part of its Services business. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note released on Wednesday that he sees a reacceleration of the Services business to a double-digit growth pace, thanks to expanding iPhone user base, improving attach rates on Services, and price increases. \u201cWe believe overall the Services business is worth $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion for Apple\u2019s sum of the parts valuation and remains an underappreciated asset by the Street,\u201d he said. Apple is scheduled to report its fiscal year third quarter results Thursday after the market close, with analysts modeling in-line to higher results and upbeat September quarter guidance. Apple closed Wednesday's session down 1.55% at $192.58, according to Benzinga Pro data.

                "body": "This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal. Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0faced a host of initial\u00a0iPhone 14\u00a0sales setbacks due to a COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent riots at Apple\u2019s largest Chinese factory, the company has strategized not to face such pitfalls again. With the aim of decentralizing its supply chain from China, Apple is investing heavily in producing the new\u00a0iPhone 15\u00a0in India. What Happened?\u00a0Apple aims to manufacture 15 million\u00a0iPhone 15 units in India\u00a0this year, states a Nikkei report. Previously, India lagged one year behind China in new iPhone production, but in 2022, the gap shrunk to about a month. This year, the aim is to further trim this delay to less than 10 days. Historically, China has been responsible for 95% of iPhone production since the debut of the first model in 2007. Now, Apple is looking to shift at least 20% of iPhone 15 production to India, shifting away from the \u201cAssembled in China\u201d tag. Apple\u2019s plans for India include not just assembly, but also the creation of intermediate components such as metal casings. In addition, the company wants to migrate some iPhone product development resources from China to India, indicating the potential development of new labs and the involvement of thousands of engineers. Why the shift?\u00a0This shift is fueled by several factors. Firstly, with strained US-China relations and the Biden administration forming closer ties with India, Apple sees potential benefits. Secondly, India, expected to house a billion smartphone users by 2026, could become Apple\u2019s next big market after China. The unveiling of the iPhone 15 is expected next month, and how well India can keep pace with China in a simultaneous launch remains to be seen. Over time, this move could significantly boost India\u2019s iPhone production.

                "body": "Founder of Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) lead supplier Foxconn Technology Group (OTC:HNHPF), Terry Gou, warns of a potential crash in the U.S. stocks if a war involving Taiwan occurs, Bloomberg reports. The Taiwanese billionaire expressed his concerns in a Facebook post, stating that it could take as little as \u201c10 seconds\u201d for Wall Street to collapse in the event of a Taiwan Strait conflict.  Gou, who has been speculated to run as an independent in Taiwan\u2019s upcoming presidential election, has previously called for resuming talks between Taiwan and China. \"It may only take 10 seconds \u2014 not an hour or a month \u2014 for the Wall Street stock market to collapse if a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait,\"\u00a0Gou said in a Facebook post. While Taiwan might withstand a Chinese invasion for up to three months, the impact of a war on the global economy would be \u201cenormous and immediate,\u201d according to Gou. His comments come amid escalating tensions between China and the U.S. over Taiwan and other issues. Apple, whose majority of iPhones are assembled by Foxconn in China, could be significantly affected by such a conflict.

                "body": "Shares of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were modestly lower in premarket trading on Thursday, inspired by the broader market negativity. When Cook Talks, Everyone Listens: Cupertino's fiscal year third-quarter results due after the market close and the management commentary on the earnings call have the potential to turn fortunes around, both for the stock and the broader market. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a Wednesday note, \u201cThe entire Street will be laser-focused on Apple\u2019s quarter as when Cook talks everyone else listens given Apple\u2019s unique perch and perspective around consumer demand globally.\u201d The statement cannot be ignored as a hyperbole. Apple does its business globally. Given Apple's consumer-focused products such as the iPhone, iPad and Mac devices, the company's performance could be considered a litmus test for the health of consumers, who fuel much of the economic activity. More importantly, Apple is the heaviest-weighted stock in both the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index, with weightings of 7.7% and 11.6%, respectively. The stock, therefore, has the potential to take these indices in the direction it goes. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock China \u2013 Vital Cog: Most analysts model an in-line to slightly-better June quarter, premised on brisk iPhone upgrade activity, especially in the key China activity.\u00a0 Ives said, \"We believe iPhone units based on a clear uptick in demand around the key China region this quarter could show some upside.\" This is despite the choppy macro environment, he pointed out. Morgan Stanley's Erik Woodring said he would focus on revenue growth in the U.S. versus internationally, with an eye on China. Among the other metrics, the analyst would be watching for are total revenue, Services revenue growth and gross margin. The analyst expects these three metrics to come in at $81.3 billion, 8.8% and 44.3%, respectively. The Outlook: Ives shoots for conservative guidance for the September quarter. He sees it as \"all about the drumroll to the main event with the anniversary iPhone 15 launch slated for the mid-September timeframe.\" Woodring also said he expects soft guidance, although expecting year-over-year growth, and an acceleration in Service revenue growth. Apple Stock: After a dismal 2022, Apple stock has acquitted itself credibly. The shares of the most valued global company are up about 49% year-to-date. JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee on Wednesday established a 2024 price target of $220 for the stock. In premarket trading, the stock was down 0.39% at $191.83, according to the Benzinga Pro data.

We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: The SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) index dipped during the overnight session but has since recovered some of its losses, hovering around the critical level of 449.42. If SPY can sustain this level with vigor, the markets could see a bullish bounce, targeting 450.23 initially and potentially reaching 451.01 to 451.61. The high bull target for the day is 452.55. Should selling continue and the bears maintain control, the hard resistance at 449.42 could lead to a downward target of 447.94, with further bearish action targeting 446.31, and the day's ultimate bear target being 445.08. Thursday's (NASDAQ:QQQ)\u00a0premarket shows the Q's looking feeble. For bullish action, we need the price to reclaim 373.82, with potential upward movement to 375.18, and an ambitious bull target of 377.58. If weakness persists, bears may aim for 371.96 and possibly 370.91, with an extreme bear target of 369.39. With Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) set to announce earnings after the bell, the stock has dropped overnight but recovered slightly to trade near 191.76. Bulls will target 192.21, then 192.60, with an ultimate goal of 193.18. Bearish behavior could target 191.25, followed by 190.33, with an extreme bear target of 189.52. As Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) prepares to report earnings after the bell, the stock sits just above 128.38. Bulls may aim for 129.23, with a high target of 130.18. Should bears take over, initial targets may be 127.76, with an extreme downside of 126.46. Microsoft's\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) sell-off has persisted, now around 326.05. Bulls may push towards 328.52, 331.24, or a high target of 333.46. Bears may target 323.17, then 321.51, with a low bear target of 320.05. NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0trades just above 436.56.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has filed a patent for teaching Siri how to read lips so it doesn't have to constantly listen in with the microphone for commands like \"Siri\" or \"Hey, Siri\". What Happened: Apple's latest patent filing reveals that it is trying to teach Siri how to get smarter by detecting and understanding the motions of its users to be more accurate about what they are trying to say. See Also: Why Is Apple Killing 100s Of ChatGPT-Like Apps On the Chinese App Store? \"Data is received from a motion sensor, for instance, recording the motion of a user as the user utters a spoken input,\" Apple said in its filing, describing how the technology would work. It also mentioned the use of an accelerometer and a gyroscope, both of which are already present in iPhones. Reinforcements For Siri: While Apple seems to be pulling a page out of 1968 epic \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", it might actually need reinforcements from motion detection technology to make Siri more reliable at understanding voice commands. \"Voice control systems can result in false positive responses,\" the filing says. Motion detection would give Siri an additional data point to understand the user's commands. Apple says an always-on microphone also consumes power even when the user is not using voice commands. \"Continuously detecting and processing audio data expends power and processing capacity even when the user is not actively using voice control,\" Apple said in its patent filing as one of the reasons behind using motion detection. It adds that motion detection would be more power efficient, instead. \"Motion sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes can detect these motions while expending relatively little power compared to audio sensors such as microphones,\" Apple says. Not requiring always-on microphones would also be a positive when it comes to user privacy, but it remains to be seen how far in the development cycle this feature is.

It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "title": "Can Qualcomm Overcome The Challenge Of Elevated Inventory? 5 Analysts Deep Dive Into FQ3 Print, Outlook",
                "body": "Shares of Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) plunged\u00a0in early trading on Thursday, after the company announced weak guidance. The results came amid an exciting earnings season. Here are some key analyst takeaways from the earnings release. Susquehanna On Qualcomm Analyst Christopher Rolland maintained a Positive rating, while raising the price target from $140 to $155. Qualcomm\u2019s results and guidance were both \u201cdisappointing,\u201d due to soft handset demand, macro headwinds, and channel inventory drain, Rolland said in a note. He added, however, that the bottom now appears to be \u201cin the rearview.\u201d Although the recovery may be slow, \u201cwe still believe CEO [Cristiano] Amon is proving Qualcomm can move beyond a modem and cellular IP company to become a true broad-based semiconductor player, successfully diversifying into RF, Auto, IoT and beyond, with the tailwind of edge AI still in the very early innings,\u201d the analyst wrote. KeyBanc Capital Markets On Qualcomm Analyst John Vinh reiterated an Overweight rating and price target of $145. \u201cSmartphone demand was negatively impacted by a slower recovery in China and weak emerging market trends, while developed markets are stable,\u201d Vinh said. \u201cAdditionally, QCOM plans for additional opex reductions in 1H24 and acknowledged Huawei/HiSilicon headwinds in 2H23,\u201d he added. Check out other analyst stock ratings. Canaccord Genuity Capital Markets On Qualcomm Analyst Michael Walkley reaffirmed a Buy rating and price target of $152. Qualcomm\u2019s quarterly results were \u201cbasically in-line,\u201d given that global inventory is \u201cslowly working its way through the channel,\u201d Walkley wrote in a note. \u201cGiven the challenging macro backdrop with soft smartphone trends and slowing IoT demand, we anticipate a multi-quarter inventory correction will continue to weigh on near-term Qualcomm results,\u201d he further stated. Oppenheimer On Qualcomm Analyst Rick Schafer maintained a Perform rating on the stock. Qualcomm\u2019s results were \u201cmixed,\u201d with revenues marginally missing estimates and an earnings beat on cost controls, Schafer said. \u201cHandset weakness persists (~75% sales by our math) with mgmt seeing a more muted recovery than peers,\u201d the analyst wrote. \u201cChannel inventory lingers into year-end,\u201d he added. Raymond James On Qualcomm Analyst Srini Pajjuri reiterated a Market Perform rating on the stock. Management did not provide any update on the modem supply agreement with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is set to expire in the back half of 2024, Pajjuri said. \u201cWe struggle to find many secular catalysts barring an extension of supply agreement at Apple, which will likely be temporary,\u201d he added. QCOM Price Action: Shares of Qualcomm were down\u00a09.8% to $116.53\u00a0at the time of publication Thursday.

As per SensorTower, App Store revenues in 4Q23 (after 30 days) increased to $2.2 billion (+8% Y/Y, according to data on developer revenues from SensorTower), with total downloads (iPhone\u00a0+ iPad) rising 9.3% Y/Y.\u00a0 For July, App store revenue in China increased 3% Y/Y after rising 6% Y/Y.\u00a0 In 4Q23, the analyst saw app store dollars per download decline by 1.2% Y/Y.\u00a0 Overall, App Store trends improved Y/Y in July Globally and in the U.S. The positive catalysts of new product introduction (AR/VR headset) and stable iPhones are offset by a potentially weaker consumer spending environment in the second half of FY23, leading to the re-rating. In 4Q23, the Gaming segment increased 4.4% Y/Y to $1.2 billion, accounting for 55% of total App store revenue vs. 57% a year ago. Games remained the largest segment, followed by Entertainment (12%), Photo & Video (5%), Social Networking (5%), and Music (3%).\u00a0 China gaming segment revenue increased 3% Y/Y in 4Q23, while China gaming downloads declined 4% Y/Y.\u00a0 In July, the Chinese gaming regulator approved 88 domestic games (vs. 89 in June), which can drive further improvement.\u00a0 Recently, Apple has pulled over 100 ChatGPT-related apps from the China iOS store. In July, Chinese regulators introduced new AI model regulation set to take effect on August 15. Apps with generative AI content for the public must pass an assessment from the Cyberspace Administration of China.\u00a0 The analyst modeled continued services revenue growth re-acceleration to 10% Y/Y for total services revenue growth starting 4Q23 (in line with app store recovery) attributed to both easier Y/Y compares (-3.5% global app store revenue in 4Q22) and continued new game approvals in China (around 500 so far in 2023).\u00a0 The analyst's investor conversations suggest that expectations are for a modest beat in the quarter and for AAPL to guide inline (flat Y/Y) to better (he expects a slightly weaker guide that is down Y/Y in total revenue for the September quarter).\u00a0 Price Action:\u00a0AAPL shares traded lower by 0.32% at $191.97 on the last check Thursday.",

                "body": "Stocks are attempting to stabilize after a volatile session on Wednesday, with the tech sector showing slight signs of recovery while awaiting the quarterly earnings reports of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), scheduled to be released after Thursday\u2019s closing bell. Meanwhile, long-term Treasury yields continue to rise, causing a sharp steepening of the yield curve. The 30-year Treasury yield has surged by 12 basis points to 4.3%, while the 10-year yield has climbed by 10 basis points to 4.18%, both reaching their highest levels since November 2022. The bond market has been impacted by Fitch\u2019s U.S. ratings downgrade and announcements of larger-than-expected issuances for the current month, which have put pressure on bond yields. Looking ahead, Friday will bring the highly anticipated release of July\u2019s labor market data, with economists predicting a small decline in non-farm payrolls by 9,000 to 200,000, an unchanged jobless rate of 3.6%, and a cooling growth in hourly wages at 4.2% year-on-year. Cues From Thursday's Trading: The S&P 500 was broadly unchanged, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 flipped to gains, up 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1% higher, while small caps in the Russell 2000 index were flat.   US Index Performance On Thursday Analyst Color: The odds are increasing that stocks could finally take some type of break, said Carson Group's Ryan Detrick. The analyst sees a modest pullback of approximately 5% to be \u201cperfectly normal,\u201d given the S&P 500 closed higher for five consecutive months. August, the analyst noted, is a poor performer and trailed behind only September and December in the last 10 years. Historically, when the S&P 500 Index was up more than 17.5% for the year ahead of August, the month has mostly seen negative returns, Detrick added. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett said the Fed may not begin to cut rates any time soon, as the core inflation is still too hot for its liking. \u201cConsider rebalancing toward value-style equities or those with \u2018growth at a reasonable price\u2019 attributes,\u201d she suggested.

The stock was trading\u00a0lower\u00a0heading into the event.\u00a0 When the tech giant printed its second-quarter results on May 4, the stock surged 4.69% the following day and continued in its uptrend, which eventually led Apple to reach a new all-time high of $198.23 on July 19.\u00a0 For that quarter, Apple reported EPS of $1.52 on revenue of $94.8 billion. The company came in ahead of\u00a0estimates for EPS of $1.43 on revenues of $92.96 billion.\u00a0 For the third quarter, analysts estimate that\u00a0Apple will print earnings per share of $1.09 on revenues of $74.24 billion.\u00a0 Ahead of the event, JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained an Overweight rating on the stock and raised a price target from $190 to $235.\u00a0Read more here\u2026\u00a0 From a technical analysis perspective, Apple's stock looks neutral heading into the event, having broken bearishly from a rising channel and negated its uptrend but on low volume, which indicates Thursday's drop could be a bear trap.\u00a0 It should be noted that holding stocks or options over an earnings print is akin to gambling because stocks can react bullishly to an earnings miss and bearishly to an earnings beat.\u00a0 Options traders, particularly those who are holding close-dated calls or puts, take on the extra risk because the institutions writing the options increase premiums to account for implied volatility.\u00a0 Want direct analysis?

If the stock receives a bullish reaction to its earnings print and pops back up into the pattern, it may find resistance at the upper ascending trend line of the channel.\u00a0 Read Next:\u00a0Stocks Mitigate Losses Ahead Of Apple, Amazon Earnings; Treasury Yields Rocket On Debt Frenzy: Thursday\u2019s Market Drivers Photo via Shutterstock.

                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced fiscal year third-quarter results that came in ahead of expectations, propelled by strong Service sector growth. The company also said its installed devices of active bases rose to a record. While Mac sales exceeded expectations, the rest of the product categories, including the iPhone came in slightly shy of estimates. Apple\u2019s Key Q3 Metrics: Cupertino, California-based Apple reported third-quarter earnings per share, or EPS of $1.26 on revenue of $81.8 billion.  Analysts, on average, estimated EPS of $1.19 on revenue of $81.7 billion for the quarter. Apple\u2019s fiscal third quarter is typically the slowest for the company, given it comes ahead of the back-to-school season and buyers push back purchases of key hardware products in anticipation of the launch of newer iterations. Third-quarter gross margin came in at 44.52%, nearly flat with the previous quarter\u2019s 44.26%. A year-ago, the metric was at 43.26%. How EPS/Revenue Compare With Prior-Year Periods: Ahead of the earnings, analysts called for at least in-line to higher results for the quarter, premising their expectations on higher iPhone shipments amid demand recovery in China and a favorable mix shift, pushing up the average selling price. They also expected an acceleration in Service revenue growth. Commenting on the results, CEO Tim Cook said, \u201cWe are happy to report that we had an all-time revenue record in Services during the June quarter, driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions, and we saw continued strength in emerging markets thanks to robust sales of iPhone.\u201d CFO Luca Maestri said the company\u2019s installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in every geographic segment.

The company announced a common stock dividend of $0.24 per share, payable on Aug. 17, to shareholders on record as of Aug. 14. Forward Outlook: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said he expects a cautious September quarter guidance from Apple, given the next iteration of flagship product, the iPhone will likely launch by mid- to late-September.  Apple will likely provide more details on the financial outlook on the earnings call scheduled for 5 p.m. EDT. Cook & Co might need to defend or address concerns about various issues, including their future prospects, the economic recovery in China, their focus on emerging markets, and the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset that the company announced in June, among other matters. Apple Stock: Apple shares have risen about 47.6% so far this year, outperforming the Nasdaq 100\u2019s 40.4% gain. The S&P 500 Index, meanwhile, has gained a more modest 17.3%. JPMorgan\u2019s Samik Chatterjee Wednesday announced a 2024 price target of $220 for Apple share.  After settling Thursday\u2019s regular session at $191.17, down 0.73%, the Apple stock fell an incremental 0.66% to $189.90 in after-hours trading, according to Benzinga Pro data.

                "title": "6 iPhone Features That Android Or Nokia Phones Pulled Off Before Apple",
                "body": "The smartphone industry has constantly evolved, with companies drawing inspiration from their competitors. However, many users get defensive about their platforms and treat their favorite companies as sacred. One of these rivalries that has been constant over the last decade is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google \u2013 the iOS vs Android debate has always sparked debates about who copied whom. The reality is less controversial \u2013 both Apple and Google have copied each other several times and will likely continue to do so in the future. Despite this, several differences make both iOS and Android unique in their own right. In this story, we look at some features that Apple borrowed from Android or even the ancient Nokia phones running the Symbian operating system. See Also: Keep Your Pictures Safe From AI Using These Tools 1. Standby Mode One of the highlights of the iOS 17 update is Standby Mode. It turns iPhones into a sort of smart display. At its core, though, it is a variation of always-on display, a feature that has been available on Android smartphones for a long time. But that's not it \u2013 Nokia introduced it back in 2008 with the iconic Nokia N70 and Nokia 6303. It further refined the feature in 2010 with the iconic Nokia N8. 2. Home Screen Widgets Home screen widgets are another nifty addition to iOS \u2013 Apple introduced them in 2020 with iOS 14, allowing users to glance at information and do more without having to open apps. Android phones have supported home screen widgets for over a decade. Prior to it, Nokia phones also supported them across a range of apps, including email, calendar, and more. 3. Lock Screen Customization Apple also introduced some more important customization options with iOS 16, with the lock screen being one of them. With this update, Apple allowed users to change the clock's font, add widgets, emojis, and more to make it their own. On the other hand, Android phones have allowed lock screen customization for a long time. Google also allowed widgets at one point but removed them in Android 5.0. Fortunately, the open nature of Android means that companies like Samsung and others have allowed widgets in different capacities. 4. Default Apps One of the criticisms of iOS for a long time was the inability to set default apps, a feature that has been available on Android for a long time. Thankfully, Apple has ceded some ground here, allowing users to change the default email and web browsing apps. Apple still has more work to do here, but this is a start. 5. App Library Apple introduced a new feature called App Library in iOS 14. It is basically an app drawer, and Apple also automatically categorizes apps into groups like Social, Entertainment, and more. Android phones have had app drawers for a long time, and of late, launchers have also had automatic app categorization features available. 6. Picture-in-Picture Mode Google introduced picture-in-picture mode with Android 8.0. This allows users to enjoy clips from apps like YouTube or Netflix in a small floating video while using other apps or performing other tasks. Apple introduced it in iOS 14.

                "body": "The iPhone 15 Pro launch could be on track despite rumors of delays due to supply and manufacturing hiccups. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and carriers are preparing for the launch event likely scheduled for September 13, which aligns with Apple's usual iPhone launch time frame. What Happened: Apple and carriers in the US are gearing up for the iPhone 15 Pro launch event on September 13, reported 9to5Mac. See Also: Apple iPhone 15 Pro Could Surprise Buyers With A Price Hike Carriers have reportedly asked their employees to refrain from taking leaves on September 13 due to a major smartphone launch. Although it's unclear if they are referring to other phone launches, Apple usually launches new iPhones in September every year. It also has a 55% market share in the US, so connecting the dots suggests it is very likely the iPhone 15 series. Earlier reports from analysts suggested the iPhone 15 series launch could be delayed, citing supply chain checks. However, Apple has since then placed orders for displays, and its supplier, Samsung, has started manufacturing them. Even if there are delays, Apple could announce in September and start shipping out orders later. This has also happened, too, so it's entirely unexpected. For instance, the iPhone 14 Plus went on sale in October last year, while the launch happened on September 16. September Event Expectations: At its September event, Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 15 series along with other hardware, including the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. It is also scheduled to release the final versions of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, and macOS Sonoma. Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares traded down in premarket trading on Friday as softer fiscal year third-quarter hardware product sales, with the exception of Macs, and disappointing September quarter guidance warded off investors. The company reported third-quarter earnings of $1.26 per share and revenue of $81.8 billion, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.19 per share and $81.7 billion, respectively. Despite the headline beat, investors were worried because iPhone sales of $39.67 billion that came in shy of the consensus forecast of $40 billion. The company, however, did say iPhone\u2019s active installed base grew to a new all-time high. \u00a0iPad and Wearables, Home & Accessories sales also trailed forecasts. Apple's Services business saved the day for the company, as revenue from the segment clocked a record total of $21.21 billion, exceeding the consensus estimate of $20.74 billion. CEO Tim Cook said the company had more than $1 billion in paid subscriptions for the segment. Mac sales also came in ahead of expectations amid the transition of the entire lineup to in-house chips. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock On the earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects September year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the one seen in the June quarter, which saw a 1.4% year-over-year topline decline. This should come as a surprise as most analysts, including JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee, expected the company's year-over-year revenue decline streak to end. The company hinted at forex negatively impacting revenue by 2%. Apple also said it expects year-over-year performances of the iPhone and Services segment to accelerate from the June quarter. Mac and iPad revenue will likely decline by double-digits year-over-year due to tougher comparisons, it added. In premarket trading, Apple stock fell 1.49% to $188.33, according to Benzinga Pro data.

What Happened?\u00a0Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, announced this development during a call discussing the April-June quarter, mentioning the company\u2019s record-breaking, double-digit iPhone sales in India during the period.

Why it matters?\u00a0Despite a small share in the smartphone market, Cook sees enormous potential in India, given it\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone market, mostly dominated by mid-range phones.

                "body": "Artificial intelligence has taken the world by storm this year and now, with generative AI being hailed as a revolution for its ability to carry out complex conversations and generate original content. Now, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andrew Jassy has outlined the three layers of generative AI, breaking down how it will impact organizations and customers alike. What Happened: During Amazon's June 2023 quarter earnings call, the company's CEO, Jassy elaborated on Amazon's AI efforts at a time when technology companies are seeing a sea change in their workflow evolution. See Also: Keep Your Pictures Safe From AI Using These Tools To be clear, Big Tech hasn't just started working on AI this year after ChatGPT burst into prominence. Jassy underlined this explicitly, as did Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). In the case of Amazon, however, the initial work on AI is directed at businesses, not customers, which is why we don't see consumer-facing features aplenty yet. \"[We started] working several years ago on our custom AI chips for training called Trainium and inference called Inferentia that are on their second versions already,\" said Jassy. Further elaborating on this, Jassy explained that there are three layers of generative AI, but most people end up focusing only on the one layer that is customer-centric. \"Generative AI has captured people\u2019s imagination, but most people are talking about the application layer, specifically what OpenAI has done with ChatGPT,\" Jassy explained. Lowest Layer: This is the layer developers target to develop generative AI applications. Think of it as developers requiring computational power to develop and process data sent and to by users. Middle Layer: The middle layer is the myriad of large language models being offered as a service. Stable Diffusion, GPT-4, and Dall-E are some examples of these large language models. These LLMs are also offered as a service by developers targeting the lowest layer, with some services even offering an option to choose between any of these LLMs. Top Layer: ChatGPT is an example of the top layer, which includes applications that run on top of these large language models. These applications have attracted most of the public's attention. Image source \u2013 Wikipedia Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

Tech firms are now engaging with New Delhi to quickly obtain licenses, especially with the Diwali shopping season and the back-to-school period approaching.\u00a0 The ban has added challenges for manufacturers already facing a global glut of inventory and sluggish sales growth triggers. This move may lead to delayed product launches or shortages in a market heavily relying on overseas shipments. The import restriction marks India's efforts to reduce import dependence and foster a world-class tech manufacturing industry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is seeking applications for a 170 billion-rupee ($2.1 billion) financial incentive plan to attract laptop, tablet, and hardware manufacturers to the country as companies seek to diversify their supply chains beyond China. The sudden policy shift coincides with Samsung, Apple and its suppliers, and other U.S. companies' preference towards the country to diversify their\u00a0supply chain base.

                "body": "Microsoft Corp.'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) $10 billion investment in OpenAI and the success of ChatGPT has claimed its first casualty \u2013 Cortana. Microsoft is killing its smart assistant in Windows 11. What Happened: Microsoft is rolling out an update for the Cortana app on Windows 11 to essentially kill it, as the company instead pivots to Bing Chat, powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT. See Also: These Are The Three Layers Of Generative AI, According To Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy Microsoft's support document underlines this, saying, \"We are making some changes to Windows that will impact users of the Cortana app. Starting in August 2023, we will no longer support Cortana in Windows as a standalone app.\" This shouldn't surprise me \u2013 Cortana has not received any major feature update in nearly two years. Microsoft has also bet big on OpenAI, with an investment of over $10 billion in the company. The subsequent success of ChatGPT and GPT-4 has not only changed the way AI chatbots are looked at, but it has also led to Microsoft aggressively integrating it into its various apps, including the Edge browser, and the Bing apps for Windows 11, Android, and iOS. Microsoft has also integrated it into its subscription service as \u2018Copilot'. Cortana was first launched in 2014, debuting on Windows Phone 8 smartphones and Windows 10, taking on Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri. It also competes with Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, and Samsung's Bixby, to name a few. However, now with ChatGPT-powered Bing Chat out there, with much smarter processing and responses, Cortana has become redundant. Is Siri Next? Apple CEO Tim Cook said in the June 2023 earnings call that the company has been investing in AI research for several years now. Apple has also had internal tussles over how to modernize Siri, but its focus on user privacy has trumped those demands until now. It remains to be seen if Apple eventually kills Siri or gives in to growing demands for modernizing it, but its competitors have moved on.

                "title": "Amazon Knocked Q2 Out Of The Park",
                "body": "Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported blowout profits, topping sales estimates and issuing strong guidance. The latest results included the titan's biggest earnings beat since its 2020's fourth quarter as it successfully returned to double-digit growth. Unsurprisingly, Amazon stock rose went up more than 10% in extended trading, rising 52% year to date, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) who also reported its fiscal third quarter results also topped both top and bottom-line estimates thanks to its service business, but this was overshadowed third consecutive quarter of revenue declines with its stock declining 2.5% after-hours upon the results. Amazon generated $134.4 billion in revenue that grew 11% YoY and resulted in a net income of $6.7 billion, or 65 cents a share. What a difference compared to 2022's comparable quarter when Amazon made a loss of $2 billion, or 20 cents a share, owed to its markup of EV startup, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN). Amazon did an efficient job at cutting costs with global headcount falling 4% YoY to 1.46 million people as of the end of the reported quarter, having cut 27,000 jobs since last fall in largest layoffs since the company's inception. AWS growth stabilized as customers put cost management aside to focus on new workloads, leading to a 12% in revenue to $22.1 billion that topped Wall Street's estimate of $21.8 billion. Still, it was a deceleration compared to previous quarter's 16% growth while also being the slowest growth rate since 2015, which is when Amazon started disclosing cloud revenue. During the reported quarter, AWS made 70% of the company's operating profit that amounted to $7.7 billion. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized that although the company's big bet on AI still hasn't resulted in faster gains for AWS, prospects remain bright as the tech giant continues to experiment with the e-commerce shopping experience and using it to sum up customer feedback on products. Moreover, Jassy noted that generative AI releases strengthened the leadership position of its cloud business that competes with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Advertising continues to boom with unit revenue skyrocketing 22% to $10.7 billion, topping the $10.4 billion that Wall Street expected. For the sake of comparison, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) reported a 11% rise in this business segment, being its second consecutive quarterly increase after a brutal year that came after Apple introduced privacy changes, with Google being far behind the two with only 3.2% revenue growth. Therefore, as the slumping digital ad market shows signs of improvement, Amazon's online advertising business is getting bigger. According to Insider Intelligence, Amazon holds 7.3% of the worldwide digital ad market, while Alphabet owns 28.8% and Meta 20.5%. Apple damaged Meta with its 2021 iOS privacy update by limiting its power to target ads, as some companies and retailers shifted their ad budgets to platforms like Amazon. As a result, Amazon's ad business expanded over the past year while Meta's core digital ad business shrank last year. Although its latest result showed Meta is rebounding, it is just not doing it at the cost of Amazon's share that keeps on growing. Fueled by the success of July's 48-hour Prime Day discount event that Amazon touted as its biggest ever, sales for the undergoing quarter are now expected in the range between $138 billion and $143 billion, which implies a growth rate between 9% and 13%. While growth that mega tech companies reported remains below historical standards, results show that they are rebounding after a tough year with cost-control initiatives fueling profitability. What these Big Tech reports all have in common is that they are going full speed ahead in the same direction- towards a generative AI-powered future.

                "title": "Apple's Cautiously Navigating Through No Man's Land Amid A Maturing Smartphone Market And Upcoming AI Innovations",
                "body": "Together with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday. Although it topped both sales and earnings expectations like Amazon, shares fell 2% upon the report during extended trading as Apple did not provide any guidance due to uncertainty after a third consecutive quarter of declining sales. On the other hand, Amazon shares surged more than 7% after hours and continued to so in premarket trading on Friday, but Amazon did not only squash estimates but also provided a strong outlook fueled by its biggest yet Prime Day event that took place in July.\u00a0 For the quarter ended on July 1st, sales still fell 1% YoY despite service revenue growing 8% YoY. Total revenue amounted to $81.8 billion, beating Refinitiv\u2019s estimate of $81.69 billion. Earnings per share rose 5% to $1.26, topping analyst expectations of $1.19 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\u00a0Gross margin of 44.5% topped Refinitiv\u2019s 44.2% estimate. iPhones brought in $39.67 billion to the revenue table, below Refinitiv\u2019s consensus estimate of $39.91 billion as iPhone sales contracted 2%. Mac revenue was down 7% as it amounted to $6.84 billion, surpassing Refinitiv\u2019s consensus estimate of $6.62 billion. iPad revenue contracted as much as 20% as it amounted to $5.79 billion, far below Refinitiv\u2019s $6.41 billion consensus estimate. Other Products revenue that includes wearables such as Apple Watch and AirPods rose 2% as it brought in $8.28 billion, but coming in below the estimated $8.39 billion. Last but certainly not least, service revenue that was also the highlight of the report, rose 8% YoY to $21.21 billion, topping the estimated $20.76 billion. Apple is said to now have 1 billion subscribers on its platform, which includes both Apple services and third-party apps, rising from 975 million subscribers it reported for the previous quarter. Like its Big Tech peers, Apple ramped up its AI spending, with research and development costs coming up to $22.61 billion for the fiscal year so far, which is $3.12 billion higher compared to last year\u2019s comparable period. But, AI is still not showing any visible gains, but this is even the case for Amazon and its AWS unit as both companies continue experimenting with ways in which\u00a0this developing\u00a0technology can enhance their products and consumer experiences. Apple\u2019s sales in China grew 8% YoY and what is interesting is that Apple seems to have outperformed what has been the weakest smartphone market in the country in almost a decade.\u00a0Counterpoint Research reported that overall smartphone sales in the country contracted 8% but Apple CEO Tim Cook informed investors that iPhone sales in China grew by \"double digits\u201d with other segments also reporting high sales. Apple got $15.76 billion in revenue from the greater China region with sales expanding from $14.60 billion recorded during last year\u2019s comparable quarter, it generated.\u00a0Besides new iPhone owners, Cook also revealed the company set quarterly records wearables, home and accessories, and services in the world's greatest market. Although an official guidance was not given due to macroeconomic uncertainty, the tech giant reflected on its\u00a0views for the undergoing quarter with only the gross margin being said to be expected between 44 and 45% with OpEx in the range from $13.5 and $13.7 billion. \u00a0CFO Luca Maestri\u00a0said the September quarter revenue is expected to decline with performance anticipated to be similar to the June quarter. This\u00a0implies that the\u00a0sales forecast falls below analyst expectations of roughly flat fiscal fourth-quarter sales of $90.19 billion that Refinitiv\u2019s survey of analysts were expecting. iPads and Macs revenue is expected to drop by double-digit percentages but iPhone sales are expected to do better and the already strong growth rate of Apple\u2019s Services unit is expected to rise further. Therefore, the unofficial outlook can be summed up as similar to the latest reported quarter, but hopefully slightly better. Apple will continue facing the struggling smartphone market with\u00a0iPhone having to fight for market share against its Android rivals, while its next big product that is expected to push the boundaries of its existing business model, Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, still hasn\u2019t reached consumers. Therefore, the world is waiting to see Apple\u2019s new way of \u2018enriching\u2019 the lives of its consumers\u00a0while Big Tech enters a new chapter, one that will undoubtedly be powered by generative AI.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, and MSFT. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: In Friday's\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) premarket session, SPY has shown signs of fading, currently trading around the critical level of 449.42. Should this level prove resilient, we anticipate bulls might push towards 450.23. With a strong hold above that, further gains to 451.01 and 451.61 are possible. In a bullish scenario with widespread surges in stocks, a breakout above 451.61 could lead to a target of 452.55. Conversely, if sellers dominate the session, a move down to 447.94 may occur, with significant weakness possibly leading to a sharp drop towards 446.31. The day's ultimate bearish target stands at 445.08. \u00a0The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) have trended downward during Friday's premarket but are finding some support at 373.82. A successful defense of this level by the bulls might lead to probing higher targets at 375.18 and 375.98, with an ambitious bull target of 377.58. If weakness prevails in large cap tech, and a meaningful bounce is absent, a break below 373.82 could lead to an aggressive bear target at 371.96, with the day's final bearish aim within the channel of 370.91 and 370.08. Despite surpassing EPS and sales expectations, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0shares have declined about 2% in after-hours trading following a third straight quarter of revenue decrease. The stock is now slightly below our key level of 185.86. If bullish activity emerges above this level, a rebound to 188.05 is plausible. Should the stock continue to languish below 185.86, targets of 184.96 and 184.09 may be tested, with an aggressive bear target of 183.38. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0seems to have reached its low point at 328.52 in Friday's premarket. For bullish momentum, we're targeting the upside level of 331.24, with a high bull target of 333.46. If resistance is met at 331.24, the auction may drift back down to 328.52, and a break below could see bears aiming for 326.05. Final Word: remarket jobs data. Given that it's the week's last trading day, weekly options expiry might influence trading flows. Stay alert and approach the market with caution. Good luck!

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has defied the slowdown in the global smartphone industry, with its share of the overall industry's profit hitting a new record in the June quarter. What Happened: Even as the global smartphone industry reported a decline in profits, Apple increased its share of profits to 85% in the June 2023 quarter, significantly up from 81% in the same period last year, according to data from Counterpoint Research. See Also: iPhone US Shipments Take A Hit In Q2 \u2014 But It\u2019s A Minor Dent Compared To Android\u2019s 38% Plunge The report says that the global smartphone industry reported an 8% decline in revenue and a 3% decline in profit on a year-on-year basis. Despite this, Apple's share in the global smartphone industry's profits hit a new record of 85%, up from 82% last year. In the same period, Apple increased its share of global smartphone industry revenues from nearly 42% last year to 45% now. If this sounds like a repeat of another story, that is because Apple's market share in the US rose from 45% in the June 2022 quarter to 55% in June 2023. Despite a slowdown in global smartphone shipments, revenues, and profits, Apple is making more money, defying the global trend. Counterpoint's Research Director, Jeff Fieldhack, credits a richer product mix for this. \"Apple's average selling price (ASP) increased thanks to a growing contribution of the Pro series, declining contribution of the SE series and the replacement of the Mini in iPhone 13 with a Plus in iPhone 14,\" he said. The next few quarters could prove to be even better for Apple, with the company expected to increase the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max prices by $100 each. This will also be Apple's first price hike since the company launched the \u2018Pro' branded iPhones. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

                "body": "To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.  Please\u00a0click here\u00a0for a chart of iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT). Note the following: In The Arora Report analysis, here is an important piece of new data that prudent investors should pay attention to.\u00a0The\u00a0U.S. Treasury Department has announced that it plans to borrow about $1T\u00a0in the third quarter.\u00a0This is the largest amount ever to be borrowed by the\u00a0U.S. in any third quarter.\u00a0More importantly, the amount to be borrowed is about $200B more than the prior estimates. Money flows in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon, and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) are positive in the earning trade. Money flows in Apple, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are negative in the early trade. Money flows in Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) are mixed. The momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade.\u00a0Smart money is inactive in the early trade. The momo crowd is buying gold in the early trade.\u00a0Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV).\u00a0 The momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade.\u00a0Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see oil ratings. The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (ASCA: USO). Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is range bound. Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is neutral.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\u00a0To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.\u00a0The Arora Report correctly called the 2008 financial crash, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, the COVID crash, the post-COVID bull market, and the 2022 bear market.\u00a0Please click here to sign up for a free forever Generate Wealth Newsletter.

                "title": "Is Apple Stock's Risk-Reward Still Attractive After Q3 Earnings, Lighter iPhone Revenues? 'New Chapter Of How Investors View Apple'",
                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s third-quarter results Thursday failed to impress Wall Street, and the stock promptly reacted with a move to the downside. Here\u2019s what the Street has to say.  The Apple Analysts:  Reduce Overweight Positions, Says Bernstein: Apple's full-year revenue guidance of 7% growth appears high, says Bernstein's Sacconaghi, as he sees the iPhone 15 as more evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The analyst expects the softer uncertain macro and consumer environment to hurt Apple. The company also faces a 53-week comparison, he added. \u201cWe view near-term risk-reward on AAPL as relatively balanced; Investors may want to look reduce overweight positions, beginning in September,\u201d Sacconaghi said. The analyst based on his recommendation on seasonal trading pattern and the stock's stretched valuation. The third-quarter earnings outperformance was due to lower-than-expected operating expenses and a lower tax rate, the analyst said. Credit Suisse's 3 Key Takeaways:\u00a0 Following Services business outperformance, fueled by record performances for four categories and quarterly records for three categories, Credit Suisse's Cross said she sees further acceleration ahead. As the ad market continues its recovery and the company laps tough App Store comps, the business will likely accelerate, thanks to a record installed base of active devices, she said,. The analyst also pointed to strong gross margin guidance of 44%-45% for the fourth quarter, as the company benefits from favorable commodity costs, a growing mix of Services, scaling up of newer businesses and timing of product releases. Emerging markets have been a bright spot for Apple for its hardware sales, with particularly strong performance in India, Indonesia, Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, Cross noted. The analyst does not see a margin hit from the higher mix of emerging market sales, as Apple mainly targets wealthy customers in these countries, Cross continues to expect 8% revenue growth for the fiscal year 2023. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About AAPL Stock Cost Savings Make All The Difference For Apple, Says Needham: Apple's record high gross margin of 44.5% for the June quarter came about due to cost savings and a shift toward Services, analyst Martin said. The analyst also noted that Apple's cost control, slowed hiring and better expense management reined in operating expense growth. Apple's Tim Cook said on the call the company is researching use cases for generative AI in its products, Martin noted. AI/ML is core fundamental technology integral to every product the company makes, she noted. US Slowdown To Hurt, Rosenblatt Says: Until a material new product category takes hold, a slowdown in the U.S. is likely to last, Crockett said. \u201cAnd that is uncertain both in timing and success, leaving little reason to favor shares now trading near peak absolution and relative multiples,\u201d he said. Services Star Of Show, Wedbush Says: Apple bull Daniel Ives said the quarter qualifies as \u201cgood\u201d due to an in-line revenue estimate, and a strong bottom-line beat despite 400-basis-point forex headwinds. The 8% year-over-year Services revenue growth exceeded expectations and will likely accelerate to double digits in the September quarter and 2024, he said. \u201cOverall, this remains a golden installed base story as Apple further penetrates its unmatched ecosystem,\u201d Ives said, adding that strong upgrade potential and higher ASPs set up Apple for a \u00a0\"mini super cycle\u201d despite the murky macro. Munster Plucks Out Positives: The most important data point from the June quarter was the record installed base of active devices, said Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster. He estimates the metric at 2.05 billion, with iPhones accounting for about 1.2 billion of these. \u201cI believe we are entering a new chapter of how investors view Apple,\u201d  the fund manager said. He reiterated his view that over the next five years, investors will see Apple as a \u201ccan't live without consumer staples company.\u201d To sustain 5%-10% revenue growth over the next seven years, Apple needs new big markets and India is key on that count, Munster said. Longer term, the analyst expects India to surpass Greater China, which is estimated to account for about 20% of sales this year.  Munster also said investors are missing the potential of the Vision Pro mixed-reality device. \u201cI believe spatial computing will join mobile as our central daily computing platforms and by 2030 it will account for more than 10% of Apple's overall business,\u201d he said. AAPL Price Action: At last check, Apple shares were down 3.19% to $185.06, according to Benzinga Pro data.

                "body": "The market is perched on the edge of a potential 10% correction, and the big tech buying bonanza is on its last legs. So says renowned hedge fund manager Dan Niles, who unpacked his perspective during a CNBC interview on Friday. Imminent Correction? No stranger to calling market turns, Niles, founder of Satori Fund, warned of a 10% market drawdown by year-end. He singled out the inflationary impact of rising oil prices, tricky inflation comparisons from last year, along with looming pressures on yields triggered by Japan\u2019s yield curve control and the U.S. Treasury\u2019s imminent issuance of a trillion-dollar tranche. Shorts And Longs: While the potential market correction looms, Niles is betting big on Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) despite his market apprehensions, while simultaneously shorting Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Niles criticized Apple for its three quarters of year-on-year declines, expecting the downtrend to extend to a fourth quarter. Add to that Apple\u2019s lofty 30 P/E ratio, and Niles deems the stock unattractive.Read also: Is Apple Stock\u2019s Risk-Reward Still Attractive After Q3 Earnings, Lighter iPhone Revenues? \u2018New Chapter Of How Investors View Apple\u2019 Conversely, Amazon\u2019s strong revenue growth against a lower multiple secures its place as the top pick in his portfolio. The Big Tech Strategy: A shift may be underway in the tech landscape, with the era of one-size-fits-all big tech investing drawing to a close. Niles highlighted the divergence in the post-earnings trajectory of the big tech cohort: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Apple shares dipped, whereas Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon posted gains. The message is clear \u2014 investors may need to ditch the \"buy the dip on everything\" strategy and start cherry-picking in the big tech space. AI, The Hidden Budget Disruptor: Towards the tail end of the discussion on CNBC, Niles reflected on the knock-on effect of the rise in AI on corporate budget allocations. As AI-driven security threats mount, companies are being compelled to beef up their security spending, often at the expense of other areas of their budgets, he noted. Niles punctured some of the AI hype, noting that mere mentions of AI in earnings reports do not guarantee success, an observation underscored by IBM\u2019s (NYSE:IBM) performance.Read next: Investors Cheer Jobs Report: Why Are These 5 Stocks And 5 ETFs Shining On Friday?

                "title": "If You Invested $1,000 In Apple Stock When The iPhone Was Unveiled, Here's How Much You'd Have Today",
                "body": "The iPhone is one of the most recognizable products worldwide and has solidified the dominance of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the smartphone sector. The revolutionary phone was unveiled by Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs at a company event in 2007. Here\u2019s a look at how investors have done in Apple stocks since the legendary product unveiling. What Happened: Now one of Apple\u2019s most successful product lines, the iPhone was first unveiled by the company on Jan. 9, 2007, at Macworld in San Francisco. The company said the iPhone combined three products: a mobile phone, a widescreen iPod and internet communications. \u201ciPhone is a revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone,\u201d Jobs said at the time. \u201cWe are all born with the ultimate pointing device \u2014 our fingers \u2014 and iPhone uses them to create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse.\u201d It was announced the iPhone would be released in June 2007 in the U.S., in late 2007 in Europe, and in 2008 in Asia. The iPhone was given price tags of $499 and $599 in the U.S. \u201cApple ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the Macintosh,\u201d the company said. The iPhone was officially released in the U.S. on June 29, 2007, and went on to be one of the most important product releases in Apple's history. The company revealed the latest version of the popular smartphone in September 2022 with the iPhone 14. The iPhone 15 is highly anticipated by the company and new rumors link the phone\u2019s unveiling to a Sep. 13, 2023 date with a release to come shortly after. Related Link: Apple Q3 Sneaks Past Estimates On Services Strength, But Stock Drops As iPhone, iPad Revenues Come In Light\u00a0 Investing $1,000 in Apple Stock: Shares of Apple traded higher the day after the announcement by Jobs. Apple shares traded for a split-adjusted $3.38 at the open on Jan. 10, 2007. Apple shares had splits in both 2014 (7-for-1) and 2020 (4-for-1), which impacted the starting price for the calculations. Based on a starting price of $3.38, a $1,000 investment in Apple stock after the iPhone announcement, an investor could have purchased 295.86 shares of AAPL. The $1,000 investment would be worth $54,911.62 today, representing a return of 5,391.2% over the past 16 years. Apple revolutionized the smartphone industry and helped change the history of the company forever with the unveiling of the iPhone. The company may have also revolutionized some portfolios for Apple investors as well.

                "body": "Each trading day features hundreds of headlines and press releases on Benzinga Pro, a source for traders to see the latest news on the overall market and individual tickers. Here is a look at the most-searched stocks on Benzinga Pro during July 2023. Year-to-date and 52-week ranges are based on July 31 prices. 1. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) 2. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) 3. Cavana Co (NYSE:CNVA) 4. Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) 5. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) 6. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) 7. Prestige Wealth (NASDAQ:PWM) 8. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) 9. Gorilla Technology Group (NASDAQ:GRRR) 10. Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) Related Link: Top 10 Most Searched Tickers On Benzinga Pro In Q1 2023: Tesla, Apple, AMC, DWAC And More\u00a0 The following stocks were the 11th to 20th most-searched tickers on Benzinga Pro in July 2023: 11. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) 12. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) 13. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) 14. PainReform (NASDAQ:PFRX) 15. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) 16. Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) 17. Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) 18. Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) 19. C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI) 20. EdtechX Holdings Acquisition Corp II (NASDAQ:EDTX) The month of July saw several changes to the leaderboard of most-searched tickers with Rivian Automotive making the biggest jump from outside the top 20 to fifth place for the month. The increase came as the electric vehicle sector saw increased focus and the company reported second-quarter production and delivery figures in the month. New IPO Prestige Wealth and Gorilla Technology Group also joined the top ten after previously ranking outside the top 20. Coinbase made a leap from 18th in June up to 10th place, ranking in the top 10 for the first time in months. Falling out of the top ten in July were C3.ai, U Power (NASDAQ:UCAR), Amazon.com and Advanced Health Intelligence (NASDAQ:ATI). C3.ai has been a leading ticker for several months in 2023 as attention on artificial intelligence stocks has increased from traders. The fall to 19th place in July could signal a lower focus on the sector or investors finding new targets. Nikola made a surprise entry in the top 20, which comes as the stock saw a surge in its share price thanks to several news items and investors hoping for a short squeeze with the stock having a high percentage of its float short.

                "title": "S&P 500 Drops After Fitch Downgrades US Government's Credit Rating; Apple Flunks On iPhone Sales, While Amazon Shares Climb To 12-Month High",
                "body": "As Treasury yields rose and America's credit rating got a hard blow from Fitch Ratings Inc., the S&P 500 slipped. When yields on Treasury bonds rise, investors lean towards selling their equity assets in favor of bonds, taking down the stock market gauge. The S&P 500 lost 2.3% on a weekly basis. The Dow Jones also dropped on Wednesday and was ultimately down 1.13% on the week. The Nasdaq Composite was the worst hit of the three major indexes, down 2.9% weekly and experiencing its worst trading day in five months Wednesday. See Also: Stocks, Bonds Rebound, Dollar Dips As Investors Welcome Jobs Data: What\u2019s Driving Markets Friday? U.S. Treasury yields reached a nine-month high after the Treasury announced it would expand its long-term debt this quarter. The government's financial agency is currently trying to make up for a growing gap between tax revenue and government spending. The 10-year Treasury note reached a yield of 4.2% this week and was 4.038% at the time of publication. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note was 4.76% Friday afternoon.  Fitch Ratings, one of the three main credit rating agencies, dropped the U.S. government's credit rating from AAA to AA+. The agency cited \"expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years, a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance.\"\u00a0 The debt ceiling crisis of recent months, which took the government very close to reaching a default, was the main reason behind the downgrade. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called the downgrade \"entirely unwarranted.\" She pointed to the robust state of the economy, which currently boasts record lows in the unemployment rate. The job market is showing strong resilience to the inflation crisis of this year. The private sector added 187,000 new employees in July, as per a fresh report by the Labor Department. The\u00a0unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. The White House also repudiated the decision, handing down the responsibility of nearing a default to the \"extremism\" of Republican officials. What To Watch: Next week we'll see earnings reports from EV manufacturer Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) on Monday and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) on Tuesday, the same day as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), Fox Corp (NYSE:FOXA) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Wednesday is earnings day for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Sony Group (NYSE:SONY). Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) reports on Thursday. Pharma investors will be paying attention to Novo Nordisk's (NYSE:NVO) call on Friday. On Aug. 10, expect the consumer price index for July to lend new information on the economy. Analysts will share their opinions on how the new report might affect the Federal Reserve's decision to pause or hike interest rate in the September FOMC meeting. The producer price index will add even more information and will be out on Friday, Aug. 11.\u00a0 Photo via Shutterstock. ",

                "body": "\"Baldur's Gate 3\" by Larian Studios had a successful debut on Amazon.com, Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Twitch and Valve's Steam with strong concurrent player numbers. The game\u00a0\u2014 launched on Aug. 3\u00a0\u2014 quickly gained popularity, reaching 340,000 concurrent players on Steam and around 480,000 viewers on Twitch, as reported by IGN. The third main game in the \"Baldur's Gate\" series offers a set of comprehensive Twitch integration features, such as allowing viewers to vote on dialogue choices and access an interactive overlay for character stats and inventory information. See Also:\u00a0'CS:GO' Shatters Records With 1.4 Million Concurrent Players Amid Rumors Of An Upcoming 'Counter-Strike 2' \"Baldur's Gate 3\" is based on Hasbro Inc.'s (NASDAQ:HAS) \"Dungeons & Dragons\" tabletop role-playing system and offers both a single-player and cooperative multiplayer element. One of the factors contributing to its success was the news about the possibility of romance options with a bear (or a Druid in bear form), which generated significant interest and propelled the game up Steam's best-sellers list. Moreover, the fact that Larian Studio's latest title comes with full nudity options, including customization options for genitals, might have contributed to the game's success. And, even though its launch had some technical hiccups, with Steam struggling to handle the demand and players unable to pre-load the game, positive reviews and impressions are starting to emerge. \"Baldur's Gate 3\" is currently available only on Windows, but will be released on Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) macOS and Sony Group Corp's (NYSE:SONY) on Sept. 6. It will also be launched for Microsoft Corp.'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox Series X/S, although the exact date has yet to be announced.

What Happened:\u00a0The apprehension arises from worries about sluggish demand for smartphones and other electronic devices. Apple's\u00a0third-quarter results on Thursday failed\u00a0to impress Wall Street, and the stock promptly reacted with a move to the downside. On Friday, the company's shares experienced a decline in pre-market trading due to weaker fiscal year third-quarter hardware product sales, except for Macs, and disappointing guidance for the September quarter. Shares of the company experienced a significant drop of 4.8%, leading to a market capitalization of approximately $2.85 trillion. This decline, the largest for Apple since September, translated to a staggering loss of over $160 billion in market value,\u00a0reports\u00a0Bloomberg.\u00a0\u00a0 Also Read:\u00a0Tim Cook Shares The One Thing He's Copied From Steve Jobs As Apple's CEO Apple's fiscal third quarter tends to be the slowest, as it precedes the back-to-school season, and customers often delay purchasing key hardware products in anticipation of newer iterations being released.

                "body": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) reported Saturday second-quarter results that showed a modest increase in operating income. The firm\u2019s investment income also reversed to a gain from a loss a year ago, thanks to the equity market rally seen in the quarter. What Happened: Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway, an investment holding company, said its third-quarter operating earnings came in at $10.04 billion, higher than last year's $9.42 billion in earnings. Operating earnings are derived from the companies Berkshire owns. The increase in the operating income reflected an increase in insurance underwriting income from $715 million to $1.25 billion. The insurance investment income also climbed from $1.91 billion to $2.37 billion. On the other hand, the firm\u2019s income from rail transportation company BNSF fell and its energy-company earnings remained flat. Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s investment and derivative gains were $25.87 billion compared to a loss of $53.04 billion. The strong performance reflected investment gains from equity securities as the stock market rallied in the second quarter. Gains from investment in equities were at $33.05 billion compared to a loss of $66.86 billion a year ago, when the stock market dove amid the economic uncertainties.

The\u00a0move has brought both excitement to the MLS and\u00a0has rewarded bettors who have backed Inter Miami and Messi in the current Leagues Cup. \u201cI think Messi is going to be a big game changer for MLS,\u201d Robins told Benzinga in an exclusive interviwew. The DraftKings CEO said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is already seeing subscription increases for its streaming platform and MLS Season Pass package.

                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) acknowledged on the earnings call that the U.S. smartphone market has been going through a slump for the past couple of quarters. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman weighed in on what this could mean for the upcoming iPhone 15 launch. Will New Features Sell? The soft smartphone market dynamics in the U.S. could pose a challenge for the iPhone 15 launch, said Gurman in the latest installment of his weekly Power-On newsletter. Reiterating his claim in the recent past, the Apple specialist said the iPhone 15 promises to be the biggest update to the device in three users. When Apple releases new features such as bigger screens with the iPhone 6 in 2014, revamped designs with no home button in the iPhone X in 2017, and 5G connections in iPhone 12 in 2020, these new features usually sell themselves, he said. \u201cThe iPhone 15's \u2018bells and whistles' would be similarly enticing,\u201d Gurman said. The Pro model, according to the columnist, would include \u201cborders around the display that are one-third thinner, a titanium frame that feels lighter and more premium than the current stainless-steel design, big camera improvements, a USB-C charging port, and a much faster processor,\u201d he said. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock Soft Consumer Clouds Sales Outlook: Sale prospects hinge not only on these features and Apple has the big ask of coaxing shoppers to spend on the smartphone, Gurman said. CEO Tim Cook blamed the U.S. iPhone softness on a slowdown in spending by U.S. consumers and currency headwinds, he noted. The company, though, expects iPhone sales in the U.S. to improve in the current period, the columnist said, adding it could be better than the 2.4% drop seen in the June quarter or even see growth. That said, overall revenue is expected to decline yet again in the September quarter, which if proved accurate, could extend the company's year-over-year sales decline for a fourth straight quarter, he said. This hasn't happened since 2001 and presents a challenging backdrop for the iPhone 15, he added. Gurman expects the iPhone 15 to go on sale around Sept. 22 following the launch event to be held either on Sept. 12 or 13. Therefore, Apple will get a week of iPhone sales in the September quarter, he said. However, the real test for Apple will be the holiday quarter, Gurman said. But one thing working in Apple's favor would be the favorable comparisons with the same period last year, which saw production disruptions at its assembly partner Hon Hai Precision Manufacturing Company Ltd.'s (OTC:HNHPF) China plant, he said. \u201cSo it shouldn't be hard for the iPhone 15 to show healthy year-over-year growth,\u201d Gurman said. But if Apple runs into its own production problem, the smartphone slowdown could be even worse than feared, he said. Apple closed Friday's session down 4.80% at $181.99, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

Despite assurances from United Airlines, the bag failed to arrive on the expected flight from Chicago.\u00a0 Armed with an AirTag, Sandra noticed that the tracker indicated the bag\u2019s presence at the baggage reclaim in Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport, contradicting the airline\u2019s claims that it was still in Baltimore,\u00a0reported\u00a0CNN.\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0After $16 VR Headset And Affordable Apple AirTag Alt, Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Jio To Launch $12 Phones Shuster\u2019s numerous calls to United\u2019s lost baggage helpline proved unfruitful, with each representative offering different explanations and failing to locate the bag.\u00a0 Given that the bag contained her 15-year-old daughter\u2019s lacrosse kit, Shuster decided against waiting for the airline\u2019s sluggish processes to resolve the issue and took matters into her hands. She booked a flight to the Windy City using her accumulated air miles. After landing in Chicago, Shuster headed straight to the baggage claim area armed with her AirTag data. Within moments, the airport staff located the bag, confirming her suspicions that it was indeed there all along.\u00a0 The whole ordeal lasted only 30 seconds, a stark contrast to the days of back-and-forth with the airline, the report noted.\u00a0 Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0Just last month,\u00a0a corporate magician faced a similar\u00a0ordeal after landing at Newark Airport.\u00a0 Surprisingly, his bag also disappeared while traveling with United. Fortunately, he retrieved his bag using AirTag data, but not before going through the detailed process of re-entering the terminal, including buying a fully refundable ticket to Boston merely for access.\u00a0 After its release in 2021, Apple\u2019s AirTag quickly gained popularity as a device meant to assist users in\u00a0finding their personal items.\u00a0 However, it later faced scrutiny when concerns arose about its potential misuse by stalkers, who could exploit its tracking capabilities to monitor unsuspecting individuals\u00a0without their knowledge or consent.

That\u2019s possible because of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes all of Apple\u2019s custom chips. TSMC is using a new process to make smaller, faster and more power-efficient chips, which it refers to as 3 nanometer, for Apple roughly a year before it makes them for anyone else. But that\u2019s not the only thing TSMC is doing for Apple: A sweetheart deal between the companies means TSMC effectively eats the cost of the defects that inevitably crop up in a new manufacturing process.",

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could finally upgrade the storage in the base model of the upcoming iPhone 15 series to 256GB storage, ditching the paltry 128GB storage. What Happened: As the iPhone 15 launch draws closer, new reports suggest that Apple could double the storage to 256GB from 128GB in the base models of its next flagship phone. See Also: Worried Your Pixel Phone Is Hacked? Here\u2019s How To Check Using Google\u2019s New Tool \"This is the supplier source. The Apple iPhone 15 Pro and Max models will have a new 2-tera option this time,\" said Korean blogger yeux1122. Another leak on the Chinese social networking platform Weibo suggests that the base storage could bump to 256GB. This would considerably increase storage space across all four tiers \u2013 128GB to 256GB, 256GB to 512GB, 512GB to 1TB, and 1TB to 2TB. That's right \u2013 a 2TB iPhone. However, given the sources, we suggest you take this with a grain of salt. Smell Test Suggests It Could Be Wishful Thinking: We have not heard of any storage bump from any prominent sources yet, so this could end up being more wishful thinking than anything else. While the Korean blogger is known for providing good enough leaks, their track record could be better than that of people like Mark Gurman or Ming-Chi Kuo. One of the justifications behind this is that Apple is expected to hike the price of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max by at least $100. This justifies the storage bump, too, the sources say. However, it remains to be seen if Apple thinks the same way, too. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

                "title": "How To Trade The S&P 500 Index And The Market By Using Options Data",
                "body": "The end of last week was probably one of the most volatile endings to the week that we have seen in a while. The S&P 500 Index\u00a0peaked at 4538 to end at 4478.That for the biggest equity market in the world is a substantial intraday move.\u00a0 There were several reasons that drove that price action. Let\u2019s start from Thursday. After market closing Apple and Amazon came out with earnings. Both of these stocks are particularly important because of their weighting in the S&P 500 Index. Amazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0weighs 3.06%, while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) 7.51%.\u00a0 For that reason, market participants were monitoring these results very closely. While Amazon came in strong, Apple gave mixed signals, with services improving, while iPhone sales were down.\u00a0 From a macro perspective we had the release of the numbers from the job market on Friday. The numbers came with mixed feelings, while Non Farm Payrolls rose to +187,000 in July; Unemployment Rate came at 3.5%, and average hourly earnings rose by 4.4% Y/Y while estimates were at +4.2%.\u00a0\u00a0 The other factor is one less understood. Post 2008, the way market participants take positions in the market has changed. We started seeing an increase of products that come with leverage. The use of Options surged dramatically, not only for institutional players but also for retail. This chart can give you an idea of how many retail traders are now participating in the options market.  Source: Twitter @MenthorQpro The option market uses leverage. For an investor this means that returns can be higher than just going long the underlying. Also if used correctly, this product can also help risk manage better. But since there is leverage, if used incorrectly it can create bigger losses.\u00a0 The increase of leverage by investors has an effect on market price action. When an investor buys an option, on the other side of the trade you have a Market Maker. This market participant is very important because it provides liquidity for investors, while making sure that there are no major disruptions.\u00a0 We will not go into too much detail about how a market maker works, but it is important to understand his participation, because as the market maker provides liquidity, he is also hedging. A market maker does not take a directional position. His role is purely to \u201cmake\u201d markets.\u00a0 In trading terms, his position and his trading book should always be flat. He stays flat by buying and selling the underlying. In the case of the SPX, while market participants buy or sell options, the market maker buys or sells an equivalent of underlying to stay hedged. This process is called delta hedging. This delta hedging activity can add or remove liquidity and create volatility like we saw last Friday. This is why, as a trader, you really want to understand how option gamma affects markets. Especially in the short term, the market is affected mostly by technical movements rather than fundamentals.\u00a0 Let\u2019s use Friday price action to understand how option activity in the market was a major force of that price movement.\u00a0 In this chart we have highlighted three key levels. As we go through those three different levels we will explain why each one of them was hit.\u00a0  Source: Twitter @MenthorQpro We are definitely in a critical part of this market. There is a lot of leverage, interest rates have been going up and the Fed direction on monetary policy is still not clear. When it comes to earnings one has to understand that at these valuation either multiples come down or you really need earnings to explode.\u00a0 All of these factors are keeping the market on edge, and even the traders in Wall Street are unclear about the path of the market. The path for this week looks still bearish. In the shaded area next to spot price you can see the 1D Expected Move. That is an indicator based on forward looking implied volatility. For now the Put Support has not moved but volatility is expected as we will be losing a lot of gamma. You can see how gamma is turning negative in the yellow bars at the bottom of the chart below.

                "title": "Want To Invest In Lionel Messi's MLS Success? There's A New Way To Get A Stake In Inter Miami",
                "body": "Soccer superstar Lionel Messi recently joined Major League Soccer (MLS) team Inter Miami \u2014 a move that surprised sports fans around the world. In his first four games with Inter Miami, Messi scored seven goals and helped the team advance to the quarterfinals of the Leagues Cup. Here\u2019s a look at a publicly traded company that can benefit from Messi's success and Inter Miami going forward. See Also: If You Bet $100 On Lionel Messi To Score In His First 2 MLS Games, Here's How Much You Made What Happened: Ares Management Corp (NYSE:ARES) recently took a $75 million preferred equity stake in Inter Miami. This was Ares's second investment (the first was back in September 2021). The terms of the preferred equity stake structure were not disclosed. Ares invested $150 million in preferred equity in the team in 2021. \u201cAres has been an important collaborator over the last two years in helping to accelerate the growth of Inter Miami,\u201d Miami co-owner Jorge Mas said in a statement, shared by Sportico. \u201cThis latest investment comes at an inflection point for the club with the planned development of our new stadium and the joining of Lionel Messi, among other key initiatives.\u201d Messi, who made his debut for Inter Miami in the Leagues Cup with Inter Miami facing off against Cruz Azul on July 21, will earn $150 million in salary over two and a half years, along with additional potential compensation. Why It\u2019s Important: Sportico valued Inter Miami at $585 million in 2022, ranking the team 10th of the 28 MLS teams at the time. Since then, Messi has helped his team continue to find ways to advance in the Leagues Cup, boosting jersey sales, ticket prices and social media engagement. All of these items could point to an increased valuation for Inter Miami in years to come. Mas predicts that the team could be worth $1.5 billion in the next year and rank as the most valuable MLS team. The Inter Miami co-owner said revenue for the team will double in the next 12 months. The original investment in Inter Miami by Ares is said to be the first private equity stake in an MLS franchise. The MLS allows teams to count institutional funds as investors, with the investments being passive minority stakes and 20% or under. Each team can sell up to 30% to institutional funds. No institutional fund can invest in four or more teams. Ares, which touts a $30 billion market capitalization, has been involved in financing for other soccer teams in recent years, including the Olympique Lyonnais takeover and a link to the takeover of English Premier League team Chelsea, according to SportsProMedia. The Ares stake in Inter Miami gives investors and Messi fans a way to invest alongside the superstar\u2019s success with the team. The Ares stake in Inter Miami is likely to represent a small portion of its overall portfolio. Other companies that could benefit from Messi\u2019s move to the MLS include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and MGO Global Inc (NASDAQ:MGOL). Apple has the exclusive rights to MLS games as part of a 10-year deal and is selling the MLS Season Pass as an add-on to subscribers for access to all games. MGO Global manages the online Messi store and could see an increase in revenue as merchandise for the superstar sees increased attention. Benzinga previously reported on asset manager Blue Owl Capital (NYSE:OWL), which owns stakes in several NBA teams, including the Charlotte Hornets, Atlanta Hawks and Sacramento Kings. The firm previously held a stake in the Phoenix Suns, which it sold for a gain. Read Next: EXCLUSIVE - DraftKings CEO Says Messi A 'Big Game Changer' For MLS  Image: Shutterstock",

                "title": "CPI and PPI Week! Was Last Week's Sell Off Enough or Is There More To Come? Prepare For The Busy Upcoming Week With MandoTrading !",
                "body": "An ugly weekly close last week, dropping ES down to the bottom (to the tick) of the weekly bullish imbalance. This week has the makings to be an extremely important one moving forward, for a number of reasons. If there is no bounce back this week back to 4553, a weekly bearish imbalance will be formed, which will act as a resistance moving forward. Another reason is losing this level of support at 4498 leaves bulls vulnerable down to 4369, which is a previously tested and filled bullish imbalance from the week of June 12. Definitely an important spot for bulls to step in with CPI and PPI data comes to end this week.   NQ, like ES, with an ugly weekly close, fading below the weekly bullish imbalance from 3 weeks ago. It will be important for bulls to reclaim the loss, with only a weekly order block at 15331 in the way of what can be a pretty harsh fade. I have some levels below, but the closest unfilled bullish imbalance is down at 14400, which is 900 points lower...  On the daily, ES dipped into a discount (below 50% of the range) bullish imbalance. If there was a place for the market to bounce, I would like to see the market bounce from here. The next question for me is how much of a bounce?... With CPI and PPI later in the week, it's a toss up for me on what happens from there.  DXY with a perfect retracement into the premium (above 50% of the range) bearish imbalance and rejection to close out last week. To me, the ideal situation for bulls would be for a fade through the 50% level and down through the support level at 100.50 towards sellside at 99.57. For those bearish on the indices would want to see a bounce at the 50% level and run towards 103.57.  This is the move I am anticipating on BTC (CRYPTO: BTC) over the next few weeks. It could absolutely take more time to make this move but this is what would make the most sense to me. Discount bullish imbalance bounce into taking liquidity (swing high) and get into that resistance at 32600.  $SPY (NYSE:SPY) finally found support following a massive meltdown to close out the week. Lots of resistance overhead, but I am looking into a retracement, which can be a big one due to the large range being set with Friday's sell off. From that point, I am undecided as it will likely be a data driven move imo.  A massive beat down Friday following ER on Thursday, is enough enough? Multiple resistance levels have been formed in the process, with sellside liquidity resting at 181.50. Even a retracement on AAPL (NASDAQ:AAPL) can move it quite a bit with the large range created on Friday.  My 250 target from last week was tapped before running higher on Thursday, only to give it all back Friday afternoon. One level of support left before swing low at 250.50 and the next level of support down to 248. Lots of resistance created like the other names as well... Is enough enough?  GOOGL (NASDAQ:GOOGL) held up despite most companies getting crushed on Friday. GOOGL is getting closer to discount (50% or less of the range) from that earnings move from 2 weeks ago. 123-125 is must defend territory for the bulls imo.  Following the earnings pump and dump, market structure shifted to the downside and concluded Friday with a retracement back into premium (above 50% of the range) and into the bearish imbalance in the .79 range. 112 is the next support level before the swing low of 107.38. Level to beat for bulls is 120.80!  Perfect OTE rejection at the .79 retracement of the swing range and took out the swing low to close the day. Bulls need to step up and take 19.30 or I see the bears being in charge for the time being. Earnings Monday AH!  Massive earnings move from Thursday on AMZN (NASDAQ:AMZN), which had been quiet for a few weeks leading into earnings. Swing low sits at 138. Like GOOGL, a retracement into discount doesn't seem crazy to me, but if we get the bounce I am expecting, the market is going to need AMZN to hold up.

                "title": "AMD, AAPL, PLTR & More: Harnessing Customer Positioning To Navigate Market Trends",
                "body": "Today, we will dive into the world of customer positioning, guided by options flow data. Our focus is on two main types - aggregated and expiration-based positioning, with AMD as our handy example. We'll remember to mix this data with other information for a full view. We'll also keep our eyes on six key stocks for the next week based on their positioning patterns. Ready to explore the exciting world of trading? Last week, the S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) took a 3% dip due to AAPL's (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings miss and slowed growth, causing a 7% downward shift in AAPL and disrupting a long-standing uptrend. Will this downturn persist? We'll consult the data soon. On a different note, AMZN\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) bucked the trend, registering about a 5% increase over the week. But, despite a Friday gap up, it couldn't sustain momentum. The key question now: will we cover the gap down or keep moving upward? Let's delve into the data.  Now that we've reviewed last week's events, let's dive into our main topic: customer positioning. In this context, we'll focus on options flow data. Simply put, customer positioning reflects the collective sentiment of investors based on their options trades. If customers are purchasing many call options, the positioning leans bullish. Similarly, selling a significant amount of put options also indicates a bullish sentiment. Conversely, if customers are buying puts or selling calls, the positioning tilts bearish. However, a word of caution: these rules often fail with indices like SPY & SPX. The reason? Their options flow is mostly used for hedging. Hence, these rules apply more accurately to individual stocks. Using the data we have at Tradytics, we can sort positioning into two main categories: aggregated positioning and positioning by expiration. If this seems a bit complex, don't worry, we'll simplify it. To view these, you'd navigate to 'Charts' then 'Indicators', and choose 'Customer Calls & Customer Puts' for aggregated positioning. For positioning by expiration, you'd select 'Options Sidebar' then 'Customer Positioning'. Now, let's delve deeper to understand these two categories. 1. Aggregated Positioning When working with flow, remember that dealers take the opposite position of what customers take. So, the customer's sentiment, which is what we focus on, is the reverse of the dealers' charts. To understand customer positioning, head to the 'Charts' page and open 'Indicators'. We divide customer positioning into calls and puts to give a clear picture of how customers use options flow. By subtracting puts from calls, we get a single figure called 'Net Premiums', which is used in the positioning by expiration. Let's illustrate this with an example looking at AMD's\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD) aggregated call positioning.  In the customer perspective, green signifies call buying (bullish), and red marks call selling (bearish). If we were to look at a puts chart, red would indicate put buying (bearish), and green would signify put selling (bullish). In the call positioning chart above, it's clear that call positioning and price movement often go hand in hand. As call positioning rises, so does the price, and vice versa. So, what's the current positioning looking like? Take a moment! It appears slightly bullish, as we see green bars recently, even if they're small. This suggests more bullish than bearish sentiment. This is only one piece of the puzzle though; we must also consider put positioning for the full picture. Let's turn to that now.  Great news! The recent increase in green bars indicates more put selling, a bullish sign. Since we see bullish trends in both call and put positioning, we can deduce that the overall flow sentiment is also bullish. That's it! That's how you decode and analyze customers' options flow to form a balanced opinion. Relying on data helps us set emotions aside and view things objectively. 2. Positioning By Expiration Looking at total positioning is crucial, but it's not the whole story. This is because it combines options flow for both short-term and long-term expirations. And clearly, different traders have varying timeframes in mind for their trades. To cater to this, we have something called 'Positioning by Expiration,' or simply 'Customer Positioning,' found in the sidebar options tab on the Charts page. Let's use AMD as our example again, but this time, we'll examine its positioning by expiration. Before we dive in, let's revisit 'net premiums', which is just the difference between call and put premiums. A quick rule of thumb - green values indicate bullish sentiment, while red ones suggest bearish sentiment.  The white-highlighted chart shows different expirations on the y-axis and net premium values on the x-axis. We've sorted the y-axis based on expiry dates, putting the nearest ones first. A glance at the chart reveals a strong short-term bullish sentiment for AMD, especially towards the August 18th expiration. But as we move towards longer-term expirations, the sentiment appears to shift a bit. From this, it's evident that a more detailed look gives us a better understanding than just an aggregated figure. So, using a combination of both aggregated and positioning by expiration offers the most comprehensive insight. This information should help you understand customer positioning and get you started on interpreting the charts yourself. You can find variations of these charts in the Options Dashboard, but I'd suggest that for more seasoned users. The two charts we discussed offer plenty of insights into understanding positioning. Please remember, since this data comes from all customer flows and all expirations, it's best used as a guide for swing or slightly longer-term trends. If you're interested in day trades, Market Net Flow & Algo Flow are more suited. We'll cover more on these in future articles. Alright, let's take a sneak peek at the week ahead by checking out the customer positioning for six big names - NVDA (NASDAQ:NVDA), MSFT (NASDAQ:MSFT), META (NASDAQ:META), TSLA (NASDAQ:TSLA), AAPL, and PLTR\u00a0(NYSE:PLTR). We'll use this to sense the mood for next week, giving us a chance to stay ahead of the game. So, let's dive right in.  By now, you should be able to identify which stocks show the most bullish or bearish customer positioning, both short-term and long-term. I'll highlight two with the clearest short-term positioning: AAPL and PLTR. AAPL appears bearish in the near term, with some improvement over the long term. In contrast, PLTR is showing lots of green bars, indicating bullish sentiment both short and long term. Interesting to note are the bearish bars for August 18th for META & NVDA, and the strongly bullish long-term sentiment for TSLA. This should give you a handle on positioning and help you make clear-eyed decisions about your trades. Positioning is just one piece of the puzzle. It's wise to consider various factors before making a final decision. For now, let's stick to positioning. Here's a little tip. To get the best results, try to identify the overall market direction. Find stocks with particularly bullish or bearish positioning. If the market is on an upward trend, you could split your trade capital - say, 70% on a bullish trade to align with the market trend, and 30% on a bearish one as a sort of safety net. If the market dips, the bearish stock is expected to fall more than the rest, providing some protection. For instance, if the market dips in the next few weeks, you could buy calls (go long) on AMD/PLTR as they show bullish positioning, and buy puts (go short) on AAPL and META. In theory, this should offer good protection and potential gains. This is a basic pairs trading strategy, which we'll delve into another time. In this week's analysis, we dove into the intriguing world of customer positioning, using options flow data as our compass. We unpacked the details of aggregated positioning and positioning by expiration, using AMD as a prime example. We observed that customer positioning can offer valuable insights into market sentiment, effectively acting as a sentiment barometer. However, it's crucial to note that this single data point should be used in conjunction with other data points to form a holistic view. Looking ahead, we have shortlisted six stocks with notable customer positioning to watch for the next week. This article was written using data from Tradytics.",

                "title": "In AI We Trust? Warren Buffett Sent 46.7% Of Berkshire Hathaway's Portfolio There",
                "body": "The AI tidal wave that started with a ripple in late 2022, courtesy of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, since engulfed the tech and business landscape of 2023.Everywhere investors turned, AI dominated the narrative. It was prominent in earnings reports and even more so in earnings calls with giants such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) mentioning the buzzword a combined 145 times during their most recent earnings calls.But as investors scrambled in the second quarter to catch the wave, the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, seems to have been already surfing in it.What Happened: Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) $364.7 billion portfolio is weighted heavily toward companies involved in AI \u2014 by some 46.7%.The spread includes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 44.9%, HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) at 1.1%, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at 0.4%, and Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW) at 0.3%. Apple, initially silent amidst the AI buzz, announced its entry with the Vision Pro augmented reality headset due next year. CEO Tim Cook said on its earnings call that Apple has been diving into AI research, echoing the capabilities of models such as ChatGPT. But Buffett\u2019s AI investments aren\u2019t just about jumping on a bandwagon \u2014 he\u2019s long been known for spotting value amidst hype, and he remained discerningly cautious about AI. Reflecting upon his sentiment at Berkshire's annual investor conference in May, he said, \u201cWith AI, you can change everything in the world, except how men think of the AI, and that is a big step to take.\u201dRead Also: Warren Buffett Reveals Why He\u2019s Not Worried About Fitch\u2019s US Downgrade: \u2018Only Question For Next Monday Is\u2026\u2019Buffett's duality \u2014 between AI\u2019s boundless potential and its overarching fears, especially concerning market valuations \u2014 is unmistakable. His balanced stance, echoing both AI\u2019s promise and the inherent risks, is a lesson in itself.With AI-centric companies influencing 2023\u2019s market dynamics, there\u2019s a clear shift toward a top-heavy advance, particularly with dominant stocks impacting key indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100.It brings up the question: What\u2019s next for the market as the AI momentum shows signs of plateauing? History offers some solace. Even during tech\u2019s extreme dominance in the late 1990s, which eventually led to the dot-com crash, there were periods where the market continued to rally despite clear signs of disparity.A lopsided market does not necessarily spell doom; usually, fundamental shifts are what turn the tide. Buffett\u2019s diversified approach, while keeping a strong foothold in AI-empowered companies, seems to be a hedged bet against any fundamental upheavals.

                "body": "Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) championed remote work with its video conferencing solutions in the post-Covid world, but it is now asking its employees to come back to the office. What Happened: Zoom has asked its 8,400-strong workforce to return to the office if they live within 50 miles of a company office. The company is enforcing a \"structured hybrid approach,\" which applies to employees living within 50 miles of a Zoom office to be in the office for at least two days a week. See Also: Goodbye 128GB iPhones: iPhone 15 Could Start With 256GB Storage, Going All The Way Up To 2TB \"As a company, we are in a better position to use our own technologies, continue to innovate, and support our global customers. We'll continue to leverage the entire Zoom platform to keep our employees and dispersed teams connected and working efficiently,\" Zoom said in a statement. This is a bit of an irony \u2013 Zoom's success was driven by the work-from-home wave which swept companies worldwide after the Covid-19 pandemic. Its share price surged by a whopping 731% between January and October 2020 \u2013 but it is down by over 87% since peaking in October 2020. Zoom Isn't Alone: The irony aside, Zoom is not the only company that has asked its employees to return to the office. Other big technology companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have also asked their employees to return to the office, despite intermittent protests from staff. This has also resulted in a decline in demand for video conferencing solutions \u2013 Zoom had to let go of 1,300 of its employees in February this year. Its CEO Eric Yuan said he would take a 98% pay cut, while other executives are looking at a 20% cut in the coming year.

                "body": "In yet another indication that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could switch to the USB Type-C port with the iPhone 15 series, images of the Type-C connector ports have leaked online. What Happened: Apple is widely expected to switch to the USB Type-C port from the Lightning connector with the iPhone 15 series, and a new slew of leaks of the port have further reinforced these reports. See Also: Goodbye 128GB iPhones: iPhone 15 Could Start With 256GB Storage, Going All The Way Up To 2TB In images of the connector ports leaked by @lipilipsi and @John011235 on X (formerly Twitter), the USB Type-C port is clearly visible. The ports are connected to other PCB components of the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPhone 15 Plus. Mark Gurman and Ming-Chi Kuo have also underlined that Apple will launch all the iPhone 15 models with the USB Type-C port in response to new European Union regulations. Interestingly enough, Kuo says that only the \u2018Pro' iPhone 15 models will get faster data transfer speeds, while the standard iPhone 15 models will feature USB 2.0, and, therefore, slower speeds. The Lightning port, too, supported USB 2.0 only. iPhone 15 Launch Date: The iPhone 15 series is expected to launch on September 13 \u2013 carriers in the US have reportedly asked their employees not to take leaves on the day because of a \"major smartphone launch\". Amongst the headline updates on the iPhone 15 series include stacked battery technology, a periscope camera on the top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max, a programmable action button on the \u2018Pro' models, and more. Apple is also expected to announce the first price hike for the \u2018Pro' models \u2013 iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max could cost $100 more. Another report suggests that Apple could bump up the baseline storage to 256GB from 128GB, with some leakers suggesting that we could see a 2TB iPhone for the first time.

                "body": "Japanese investment holding company SoftBank Group Corp. (OTC:SFTBY) is rumored to be eyeing the listing of its Arm chip design unit in an initial public offering in mid-to late-September. What Happened: Softbank, run by Masayoshi Son, will apply to the SEC later this month for a Nasdaq listing of the U.K.-based company, Nikkei reported, without citing any sources.  Arm's market capitalization at the listing will likely be over $60 billion, which would make the deal the world\u2019s biggest initial public offering so far\u00a0this year. The report also said tech giants Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Samsung would invest in Arm immediately after its listing.  The Arm parent thinks bringing these companies on board will help stabilize the stock price while listing and therefore intends to sell stakes of a few percent to each, Nikkei said. See Also: Best Semiconductor Stocks Why It\u2019s Important: SoftBank currently owns 75% of Arm shares and the remainder of the 25% is held by the SoftBank Vision Fund, which invests in tech companies around the world. The Vision Fund, Nikkei said, would sell 10-15% of its stake. SoftBank bought Arm in 2016 for $31 billion and since then its valuation has doubled, the report said. A deal SoftBank negotiated to sell Arm to Nvidia fell through in early 2022 amid anti-competitive concerns. The rumored move will likely give the IPO market a lift as it hasn't taken off in a big way since the COVID-19 pandemic.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: Currently, SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is trading below our crucial level of 447.94. For bullish investors today, we're seeking a definitive recovery of 447.94 and establishing this level as support. If trading remains robust above this level, we anticipate bullish investors to push higher towards 449.42 and 450.23. If today's market shows exceptional strength, our ultimate bullish target is 451.01. If the market is weaker today and 447.94 cannot be confidently maintained, we anticipate a downward trend towards 446.31. If bearish investors dominate the market, we expect our lower target of 445.08 to be tested. Our ultimate bearish target for the day is 443.90. Currently, the Q's (NASDAQ:QQQ)\u00a0are trading below our key level of 372.91. If bullish investors can recover this level and establish it as a solid support, we're targeting 373.82 initially, with further strength leading to 375.18 and 375.98. Our highest bullish target for the day is 377.58. If the market struggles to maintain above 372.91 today, we anticipate bearish investors to take over and push the price down to 371.96. If this level is weak, we expect bearish investors to test the lower level of 370.91. If this lower level experiences significant selling, our lowest bearish target for the day is 370.08. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is currently trading within our range of 178.61 and 179.36. For bullish investors, we're looking for a clear surge above 179.36, targeting 180.60. Further buying could bring 181.25 into play. Our highest bullish target for the day is 182.27. If Apple shows weakness today, we anticipate a sell-off through 178.61 with an initial downside target of 177.31. Our lowest target for the day is 176.29. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently trading below our key level of 328.52. For bullish investors, we're looking for a recovery of 328.52, with significant buying potentially leading to 331.24. Our highest bullish target for the day is 333.46. If 328.52 cannot be recovered, we anticipate bearish investors to test 326.05. If there is significant selling today, our lowest bearish target for the day for Microsoft is 323.17. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is maintaining above our key level of 450.04. If this level can hold as support today, we expect bullish investors to dominate and push the price higher to 454.09. If this level can hold as support, our high target is 458.20. If sellers dominate today's market and 450.04 breaks down, we anticipate a lower test at 447.05. If this level breaks down due to heavy selling, we expect bearish investors to test our low target of 442.76. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is currently trading above our key level of 246.16. If trading can remain robust above this level, we anticipate bullish investors to push higher to 248.37. If buying is aggressive today, we anticipate the market to reach 250.25 with a high bullish target of 252.38. If 246.16 breaks down due to heavy selling, we anticipate the market to trend lower to 243.98. Our lowest bearish target for the day is 242.47.

                "title": "'X's Takeover Of @Music Handle Hints Toward Possible Music Plans' - TechCrunch",
                "body": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/xs-takeover-of-music-handle-hints-toward-possible-music-plans/ X, the company formerly known as Twitter, appears to be hinting toward plans to move deeper into the music industry or collaborate with artists and labels with its recent takeover of the @music handle on the social network. The account was originally operated by software developer Jeremy Vaught, who grew the @music handle to roughly half a million followers. Last week, Vaught posted in anger that X had commandeered the account for itself, 16 years after its 2007 creation. \u201cSuper pissed,\u201d\u00a0Vaught wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of the email X had sent him informing him of the change. \u201cThe user handle associated with account @Music will be affiliated with X Corp,\u201d X\u2019s email explained to Vaught. \u201cAccordingly, your user handle will be changed to a new user handle,\u201d it read. X also offered to transfer Vaught\u2019s data, including his followers and following lists to a new account of his choosing. At the time, that data had been moved over to @musicfan, but X made a few other suggestions, like @musicmusic, @music123, and @musiclover as potential possibilities. This isn\u2019t the first time that X has seized control of a user\u2019s account after Elon Musk renamed Twitter to X. However, it is the first time that it took over a user\u2019s account that\u2019s not obviously associated with the \u201cX\u201d branding. Prior to this, X had\u00a0taken ownership of the @x handle from its operator, Gene X Hwang of the corporate photography and videography studio Orange Photography, saying it was the property of X Corp. The company thanked Hwang for his loyalty and offered him a selection of X merchandise and a tour of X\u2019s HQ, as a \u201creflection of our appreciation,\u201d in addition to moving his data to a new handle. X has also since renamed other Twitter accounts and products, like\u00a0TweetDeck, which became XPro;\u00a0Spaces, which became @XSpaces; Business, which became @XBusiness; plus various regional accounts and others. Even X CEO Linda Yaccarino became @lindayaX, post-rebranding. But Twitter grabbing @music for itself is a suggestion that the company is thinking more seriously about how to become a home to artists and musicians. That\u2019s not a new idea for the social network, but one that failed the last time Twitter tried it. In earlier years, Twitter launched a standalone music service with the debut of the #Music app.\u00a0Launched in 2013, the app was the brainchild of\u00a0We Are Hunted, a startup Twitter had quietly acquired the prior year. #Music, as the app was called, pulled in users\u2019 music from partners like Spotify and iTunes, then combined that with Twitter data from their following graph to make recommendations. Despite being one of the better implementations of social music discovery and recommendations at the time, Twitter\u00a0shut down the app the following year. Now, it appears the @twittermusic handle for this older app has had its data relocated to\u00a0@music\u00a0as X\u2019s newly acquired account has 11.5 million followers. (The creation date of September 2011 is still a mystery, however, as Vaught\u2019s account was founded in 2007 and the #Music app launched well before this date.) Today, @music\u2019s timeline includes tweets and retweets of musicians and their work, including links to YouTube videos. Though it\u2019s not yet clear what grander plan X has in store for @music, the fact it felt the need to retake the account is likely tied in with the company\u2019s renewed ambitions as a\u00a0place for creators\u00a0to gain visibility and get paid for their work. Late last month, for instance, X\u00a0opened up its revenue-sharing program\u00a0with global creators, who now share in X\u2019s ad revenue. The company also\u00a0began allowing subscribers\u00a0to upload two-hour videos\u00a0to its service, which advertiser Apple then leveraged when it\u00a0released the entire first episode\u00a0of its hit Apple TV+ show \u201cSilo\u201d on the platform. Fired Fox News host Tucker Carlson had been\u00a0posting lengthy videos\u00a0to Twitter as well, until ordered to stop by the network. Could music videos be the next step? Creators sharing their music would be a natural progression for X\u2019s creator economy ambitions. Plus, collaborations with artists and musicians could see X going up against other social networks, like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok \u2014 the latter of which\u00a0just announced a talent competition for aspiring artists\u00a0in the hopes of bringing more indie musicians to its platform. Meanwhile, X competitor\u2019s Threads from Instagram is seemingly challenged in getting artists on board,\u00a0a recent report by Music Ally noted.\u00a0It found that the 20 most popular musicians on Instagram weren\u2019t yet using Threads. At the time of the report, 14 of the 20 have yet to set up their Threads profiles, including big names like Ariana Grande, Beyonc\u00e9, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Zendaya, Cardi B, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Drake, Billie Eilish, Lisa (from Blackpink), Dua Lipa and Snoop Dogg. X, meanwhile, is in the midst of making the social network into an \u201ceverything app\u201d that would encompass creators, payments, banking, and\u00a0possibly stock trading\u00a0\u2014 though\u00a0Elon Musk denied the latter\u00a0post-publication of that report. Instead, he\u2019s expressed his interest in transforming the micro-blogging network into a place where people could\u00a0write longer posts of 25,000 characters,\u00a0send money to one another,\u00a0and\u00a0even store their cash in high-yield accounts\u00a0on X, in addition to discovering and supporting creators. Payments or even micro-payments could help fans to support the work of new and emerging indie artists, as well, which is where @music could come in. Or, perhaps, X aims to work with labels to offer its platform for music promotions, get into streaming itself, or allow for the integration of music clips into creators\u2019 content. Or maybe all of the above! As of yet, X hasn\u2019t yet telegraphed its intentions for X\u2019s new @music handle, but it\u2019s shaping up as one to watch.",

                "title": "Growth Stocks Begin Down A Slippery Slope As Apple's Earnings Miss May Be Just The Beginning",
                "body": "As I returned from vacation recently and began to dig through the charts to prepare for the week, I immediately focused on last Thursday with both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reporting earnings.\u00a0Would this provide the upside catalyst needed for the mega cap growth stocks to find support at their 50-day moving averages? By last Friday\u2019s close, the answer appeared to be a resounding no as a number of key market breadth indicators signaled a clear rotation from bullish phase to bearish phase.\u00a0In today\u2019s article, we\u2019ll break look a little more closely at these bearish breadth indicator patterns, gauge the technical damage to stocks like AAPL after earnings, and consider some downside targets for the S&P 500. As our equity benchmarks have become more top-heavy over time, given the outsized overweight of the mega cap FAANG stocks, market breadth indicators have become much more important.\u00a0Market breadth measures participation, usually using some sort of equal-weighted methodology. So while the value of the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 is based largely on the performance of the FAANG stocks, an equal-weighted market breadth indicator can tell you much more about the performance of all the other stocks that comprise those indices. The McClellan Oscillator is based on daily advance-decline data for the NYSE, but smooths out the data using exponential moving averages to form an oscillator.\u00a0When the indicator is above zero, conditions are bullish, and a level below zero suggest bearish conditions.  The McClellan Oscillator (top panel) just turned negative last week after being bullish through all of July.\u00a0If you look back at the other red-shaded areas on the chart, you\u2019ll note that all the major pullbacks in the last 12 months have been identified with this sort of bearish rotation. The Bullish Percent Indexes are a series of breadth indicators based on point & figure charts.\u00a0Abe Cohen from ChartCraft is credited with taking the simplicity of point & figure chart and adapting the signals to create measures of market breadth.\u00a0  Here we\u2019re running a Bullish Percent Index for the Nasdaq 100 index, which means the indicator (top panel) tells you the percent of NDX names that are currently showing a bullish signal on their own point & figure chart.\u00a0When the indicator breaks above 70% and then back below this extreme level, it suggests a negative rotation. This bearish signal was triggered last week, indicating that the broad advance through July has set us up for a downside rotation into August.\u00a0Note the vertical red lines which indicate previous occurrences, and you\u2019ll see that the Nasdaq 100 has pulled back to some degree pretty much every time this signal has dropped.\u00a0 When the market moves higher on stronger breadth, this confirms a broad and healthy advance with many stocks participating in the upside phase.\u00a0When these breadth indicators turn back negative, as they did last week, it usually confirms the end of the previous bullish phase. It\u2019s always newsworthy when the largest companies are reporting earnings, and last week did not disappoint with two of the FAANG stocks announcing their latest results on Thursday.\u00a0What\u2019s so interesting about this particular set of results is that the two stocks- AAPL and AMZN- had very similar technical setups going into their earnings report, but two very different reactions soon after.  Both stocks have been above an upward-sloping 50-day moving average, confirming a consistent uptrend phase.\u00a0Both names pushed to a new swing high in July, and both saw weaker price momentum going into that new high as the pace of the advance began to dissipate. After both companies reported earnings on Thursday, Amazon gapped up by about $13 on Friday while Apple gapped down to open about $7 lower.\u00a0What\u2019s very telling, however, is that by the end of the day, both stocks finished near their low for the session.  Now we\u2019re looking at a two-month daily candle chart of AAPL, which magnifies Friday\u2019s gap below the 50-day moving average.\u00a0So after the gap lower at the open, the price rallied into mid-day only to rotate lower in the afternoon to close at the low.\u00a0So that means that while some buyers jumped in and bought AAPL at a discount from Thursday\u2019s close, eventually sellers took control and pushed the price even lower.  AMZN actually gapped higher on Friday, pushing the price well away from its 50-day moving average.\u00a0But note Friday\u2019s candle, which is called a \u201cshooting star\u201d pattern.\u00a0This is where the open and close are near the lows of the day, and there is a long upper shadow.\u00a0This shows that while the stock did gap higher on the earnings beat, the end of the day was marked by profit-taking as investors were willing to cash in after the bounce higher. In both cases, the short-term reaction on Friday after earnings suggest that market participants were happy to get out of these names going into the close.\u00a0This lack of buying power into this week could lead to much further downside for these and other growth stocks. When a chart begins to rotate from a bullish phase to a bearish phase, it\u2019s always a good idea to start thinking about downside objectives.\u00a0If for no other reason, it forces you out of your predetermined narrative and encourages you to consider different probabilistic outcomes.  Assuming the S&P 500 has reached its peak for this part of the cycle, and is indeed heading lower in August, I\u2019m immediately drawn to the 4200 level for two reasons.\u00a0First, this would represent a 38.2% retracement of the bullish phase from October 2022 to July 2023.\u00a0Second, it would bring the price down to a trendline using the October 2022 and March 2023 lows. Depending on how long it would take to reach that price level, the 200-day moving average could end up being right around that level as well.\u00a0So there we have three different technical indicators all indicating around 4200 as a reasonable downside target. A move down to S&P 4200 would mean about a 9% pullback from the July high around 4600.\u00a0If you study your market history, you\u2019ll see that even the most bullish years usually have two to three pullbacks of around 5-10% each.\u00a0So this sort of further drop would not be unusual at all, but rather just the normal push and pull of the stock market cycle.

                "body": "Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is trading lower along with its peers Tuesday in sync with significant indexes after Moody's downgraded its credit ratings of 10 U.S. banks and placed six others under review\u00a0for potential downgrades. Broader market index ETFs, including\u00a0SPDR S&P 500\u00a0(NYSE:\u00a0SPY) and\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0QQQ), are trading lower by over 1% Tuesday. Also Read:\u00a0Nvidia's Demand-Supply Mismatch Imply Opportunities For This Chipmaker, Another AI Beneficiary;\u00a0Fitch Downgrades US Credit Rating Last week, Fitch downgraded the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from AAA, citing fiscal deterioration and repeated down-the-wire debt ceiling negotiations. With the downgrade, it becomes the second central rating agency after Standard & Poor's to strip the U.S. of its triple-A rating. On Tuesday, Nvidia launched the GH200 Grace Hopper platform based on a new Grace Hopper Superchip with the world's first HBM3e processor built for accelerated computing and generative AI. The dual configuration \u2014 which delivers up to 3.5x more memory capacity and 3x more bandwidth than the current generation offering \u2014 comprises a single server with 144 Arm Neoverse cores, eight petaflops of AI performance, and 282GB of the latest HBM3e memory\u00a0technology. Meanwhile, reports indicate\u00a0Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd\u00a0(NYSE:TSM) failed to keep up with Nvidia's demand for AI chip packaging.\u00a0 The demand-supply gap signals an untapped opportunity for the likes of\u00a0Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd\u00a0(OTC:\u00a0SSNLF), as per\u00a0analysts. Also in the semiconductor space,\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0AAPL), Samsung,\u00a0Intel Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0INTC), along with Nvidia are\u00a0eyeing stakes in\u00a0Softbank Group Corp\u00a0(OTC:\u00a0SFTBF) (OTC:\u00a0SFTBY) backed British chip designer Arm when it goes public in\u00a0September. The companies mentioned above are also significant customers of the chip designer. Arm looks to sell each company stakes worth \"a few percent each\" to help stabilize its stock price.\u00a0 In 2022, Arm shared its plans to go public after Nvidia's $40 billion takeover deal fell prey to regulatory opposition. Due to Nvidia's demand-supply anomalies, the industry considers Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:\u00a0AMD) as another beneficiary of AI chips. Price Action:\u00a0NVDA shares traded lower by 2.12% at $444.54 on the last check Tuesday.",

                "title": "Apple Stock Takes A Tumble: Unraveling the Factors Behind Its Consecutive Two-Day Decline Post-Earnings",
                "body": "Despite surpassing expectations with its Q3 earnings on August 3rd, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has experienced an unexpected decline for two consecutive days post earnings. Apple's Q3 earnings proved better than expected, with actual earnings of 1.26 compared to the projected earnings of 1.19. Despite the positive result, Apple's stock price has not climbed higher since but has seen a decline, breaking down through support levels. Profit-taking after the recent surge may be a contributing factor to this downward momentum. In the immediate aftermath of the earnings announcement, Apple's stock price experienced a decline of 6.46%. When also considering the all-time high from July 19th, the decline from that peak has reached 9.78%. This may raise concerns, but looking at the bigger picture, Apple's stock price has seen a growth of 37% year to date. In its quest to break the all-time high again, Apple will encounter a significant obstacle. The key level it must pass is last year's high at $182.94. In case Apple finds further weakness, there is also a safety net in place below. The August 2022 high of $176.15 could act as a support level, and with it being a major level, price is likely to struggle getting through it.  Despite the concerns surrounding this asset, it presents a potential opportunity for astute investors. The prevailing fear among some investors can actually be viewed as a chance to acquire the asset at a discounted price, with the potential for driving up its value. Ultimately, it all boils down to the epic face-off between support and resistance levels. Their interplay will be pivotal in determining Apple's future trajectory. If the stock price manages to breach support levels, it might be indicative of a bearish phase. Conversely, conquering the resistance could signal a bullish trend. At the heart of Apple's future direction is the decisive battle between support and resistance levels. How these levels interact will play a vital role in determining the company's stock price direction. After the closing bell on Monday, August 7, the stock closed at $178.85, trading down by 1.71%.",

Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and\u00a0short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12.\u00a0This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\u00a0To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

Disney has 11 current job openings seeking candidates with AI or machine learning expertise. The positions encompass every corner of the company - from Walt Disney Studios to the company's theme parks and engineering group, Walt Disney Imagineering, to Disney-branded television and the advertising team.

                "body": "Media giant The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is set to report third-quarter financial results after the market close Wednesday. Here are the earnings estimates, analyst ratings and key items for investors to watch. Earnings Estimates:\u00a0Analysts expect Disney to report revenue of $21.82 billion in the third quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The company reported revenue of $19.25 billion in the corresponding quarter last year\u00a0and reported revenue of $23.51 billion in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. Disney has beaten analyst revenue estimates in seven of the last eight quarters. Analysts expect Disney to report\u00a0third-quarter earnings per share of 97 cents. The company reported earnings per share of $1.09 in the third quarter of last year and reported earnings per share of 93 cents in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. The company has beaten earnings per share estimates in four of the last six quarters and matched the estimates in the last reported quarter. Related Link: Breaking Bob: Bryan Cranston Shows Support For Strikers, Delivers Rousing Speech Aimed At Disney CEO Bob Iger\u00a0 Disney Analyst On Sidelines, Eyes Weakness In Ads, DTC, Box Office:\u00a0Disney analysts have been lowering price targets ahead of the third-quarter report. Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen is among the analysts lowering their expectations for Disney shares, taking the price target from $103 to $94 in a July note.\u00a0 Nollen has a Neutral rating on the stock that came after a May downgrade.\u00a0 Nollen named\u00a0weakness in television advertising, direct-to-consumer declines, soft Parks trends in the quarter and the impact of the Hollywood strike by writers and actors as contributors to his lower EPS estimates and price target.\u00a0 \u201cDisney has spoken of DTC losses stepping down again by $100m sequentially, and the booking of as much as $1.9bn in impairment charges as it struggles to get this division to its target of break-even by FY\u201924,\u201d Nollen said. \u201cF3Q sub trends will likely be negative again, both in the US and abroad.\u201d The analyst also mentioned a weakened box office for Disney, with \u201cElemental\u201d and \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d underperforming. The impact of the Hollywood strike\u00a0remains a giant question mark for Disney.\u00a0 \u201cContent production is now halted due to WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, threatening production plans until resolved,\u201d Nollen said.\u00a0 Walt Disney World traffic concerns also weigh on the analyst's view.\u00a0 Another item Nollen said to watch is any asset sale discussion\u00a0by the company. \u201cAny asset divestiture, as discussed in the FT and elsewhere, could raise cash helpful to buy in the Hulu stake, but could also mark a dramatic change in the portfolio that has made Disney so successful til now.\u201d Other analyst price target updates in July included:\u00a0 Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne reiterated an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $110 to $105. Atlantic Equities analyst Hamilton Faber downgraded shares from Neutral to Underweight and lowered the price target from $113 to $76. Evercore ISI Group analyst Vijay Jayant reiterated an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $130 to $110. Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall reiterated an Overweight rating and maintained a $147 price target.\u00a0 Key Items To Watch: Among the key items for Disney in the third quarter will be its direct-to-consumer segment, which includes Disney+ and other streaming platforms. In the second quarter, Disney reported 46.3 million domestic and 157.8 million overall Disney+ subscribers, and\u00a0both figures were lower than in\u00a0the first quarter. The company reported a 2% quarter-over-quarter increase in ESPN+ subscribers in the second quarter and flat growth for Hulu, which stood at 48.2 million subscribers. One plus from the company in the second quarter: average revenue for Disney+ subscribers increased\u00a0both domestically and overall. Investors will be watching to see if Disney+ lost subscribers once again. As mentioned in the note from Nollen, Disney has had a harder time than expected at the box office. In fact, as reported recently by Benzinga, Disney may fail to have a $1-billion movie worldwide for the first time since 2014, not counting the 2020 and 2021 COVID-19 pandemic years.\u00a0 Disney released several hits during the second quarter, but investors may be anxious to hear about the poor results of several movies that came out late in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter and could impact the fourth quarter more. In the third quarter, Disney released the following films, with the theatrical gross via\u00a0BoxOfficeMojo: \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\u201d: $358.9 million domestically, $845.4 million worldwide. \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d: $297.1 million domestically, $566.6 million worldwide. In the fourth quarter, Disney\u2019s releases that have underperformed include: \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d: $170.7 million domestically, $368.8 million worldwide. \u201cElemental\u201d: $148.4 million domestically, $424.9 million worldwide. \u201cThe Haunted Mansion\u201d: $42.3 million domestically, $60.3 million worldwide. Discussion from the company on the success or failure of these movies could be monitored by investors. Disney also has two potential hits coming later in the calendar year with \u201cThe Marvels\u201d and \u201cWish\u201d both expected\u00a0in November. Benzinga's Take:\u00a0While Disney CEO Bob Iger likely won\u2019t talk specifics of any potential asset sales and will say the company is looking for a partner for ESPN, the wording and any follow-up questions from analysts could be interesting with rumors afloat of\u00a0non-core assets being up for sale. Some analysts and experts have said\u00a0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a likely candidate to buy Disney or acquire a portion of the company if Iger and the board are interested in selling. Iger recently had\u00a0his contract renewed, which led to increased speculation that he was brought on to negotiate a sale and stay through its\u00a0completion.

                "body": "Needham\u00a0analyst\u00a0N. Quinn Bolton\u00a0reiterated a Hold rating\u00a0on\u00a0Skyworks Solutions, Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:SWKS). Though Skyworks\u00a0reported 3Q results\u00a0at or above the midpoint of guidance and guided 4Q23 in line with expectations, he believes Skyworks' operating results will underperform those of its closest peer,\u00a0Qorvo, Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:QRVO), over the next several quarters.\u00a0 Bolton writes that SKWS' content is at best flat, and likely down modestly, generation to generation in the\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhone\u00a015. Though he expects Android and Broad Markets revenue will trough in the second half of CY23, he believes there are better ways to play a recovery in Android shipments. The analyst expects a slow recovery in adjusted gross margin and a reset in operating expenses in FY24 will result in only modest Y/Y growth in FY24 adjusted gross margin. Rosenblatt\u00a0analyst\u00a0Kevin Cassidy\u00a0reiterated Skyworks with a Buy and a $150 price target. Skyworks delivered a near spot-on June quarter report and September quarter guide.\u00a0 Based on the September guide, the company at least maintained its\u00a0iPhone\u00a0market share. Management also discussed various Android handset wins and Automotive, Data Centers, and Telecom.\u00a0 Like peers, lackluster demand is dragging the Android and IoT inventory correction out for another two quarters. He sees Skyworks management as navigating underutilization, internal inventory, and any company in his coverage. Raymond James\u00a0analyst\u00a0Srini Pajjuri\u00a0maintained a Market Perform rating. SWKS's 3Q revenue was in line, while EPS was slightly better on lower opex.\u00a0 The 4Q revenue and gross margin outlooks are mainly in line with consensus. SWKS benefits from relatively stable iPhone 14 demand and seasonal iPhone 15 builds. On the other hand, content gains in the iPhone 15 appear modest, and inventory headwinds persist in Android.\u00a0 The Broad Markets segment remains sluggish despite pockets of strength in Auto and Data Centers. Looking ahead, Pajjuri expects SWKS to benefit from an eventual recovery in Android and secular growth in Auto/IoT markets. Gross margins should recover over time as factory utilization improves.\u00a0 However, Pajjuri sees limited near-term catalysts and prefers Qorvo due to its more pronounced content gains in iPhone 15 and more robust presence in China/Android markets. Susquehanna\u00a0analyst Christopher Rolland maintained a Positive and raised the price target from $125 to $130. Skyworks reported in-line results and guidance after the close on Monday. The September guidance is crucial as it provides insights into upcoming iPhone content. The guidance eased concerns about significant declines in content, indicating close-to-flat content year over year (YOY). Skyworks sees potential improvement in Android bookings and demand, signaling slow recovery and normalization of inventory in the Android segment. In Broad Markets, Skyworks experienced strength in Auto (exceeded $200 million run rate), Industrial, and Wi-Fi (secured Wi-Fi 7 router wins). Infrastructure had a record quarter last quarter, and the company expects it to be a growth driver in 2024, contrary to the trend in the telco market. While in line with expectations, the report is viewed positively, reflecting better-than-feared iPhone content and opportunities in the Android segment for the following year. Price Action:\u00a0SWKS shares closed lower by 1.28% at $108.76 on Tuesday.",

                "body": "NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has taken the veil off its revolutionary next-generation platform \u2014 the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip Platform, marking a significant development in the field of accelerated computing and generative AI. This platform is poised to be a cornerstone for future AI-driven applications, from virtual assistants to advanced data analytics, according to a company press release. The GH200 stands out as the pioneer to harness the power of the HBM3e processor. Tailored to navigate the intricate maze of generative AI tasks, it comes in a variety of configurations to suit different needs. Its dual configuration, boasting 3.5x more memory and 3x the bandwidth of existing models, is anchored by a single server. This server is packed with 144 Arm Neoverse cores and a whopping 282GB of the latest HBM3e memory. For investors, this means faster data processing and more efficient algorithmic trading models. Also Read: S&P 500 Stocks Experience Puzzling Market Reaction To Positive Earnings: Analysts Investigate NVIDIA\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, emphasized the need for specialized computing platforms, stating, \u201cThe new GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip platform delivers this with exceptional memory technology and bandwidth.\u201d One of the standout features of the GH200 is its ability to connect with other Superchips via NVIDIA NVLink. This means enhanced collaboration for generative AI tasks, allowing for more complex computations and larger AI models. Additionally, the HBM3e memory, which operates at speeds 50% faster than its predecessor, HBM3, ensures rapid data access with a combined bandwidth of 10TB/sec. For businesses, this translates to quicker insights from data and more responsive AI applications. As Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization\u00a0tripled this year, the chipmaker joined the trillion-dollar club in June, alongside Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). On Tuesday, shares fell 1.8% amid a broader market concern sparked by a slew of downgrades on U.S. banks by the rating agency Moody\u2019s.  Nvidia remains by far the top-performing semiconductor in 2023, up 200% year-to-date, and is the largest holding in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH), with a 20% weight.

The analyst re-rated ahead of APP's 2Q report on August 9 despite YTD's stabilization of mobile gaming usage trends through 2Q.\u00a0 The price target boost reflects a less conservative exit-EBITDA multiple of 7.0x (terminal year FY30E).\u00a0 The timing of AXON 2.0's rollout aligned well with macro-AI/ML hyperfocus, and given the expectation for material efficacy improvement, buy-side assumptions are likely expecting the product can pull-forward the expected FY24E (consensus) recovery timetable.\u00a0 The analyst still does not believe APP's long-term business model is sound given 1) platform signals are materially dependent on fingerprinting, leaving APP at high risk to\u00a0Apple Inc's\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) inevitable eradication of the practice; 2) ongoing restrictive IDFA dynamics will continue to limit platform efficacy improvements.\u00a0 Absent proprietary data signals post-IDFA, the rescindment of incremental data feeds from its 1P Apps studio leads him to question its longer-term ROAS trajectory.\u00a0 Further, management has said it cannot predict platform efficacy improvements. The analyst reserves his questions for the earnings call. As APP continues to invest in differentiated ML, he wanted to understand how Software Platform incremental revenue flow to the bottom line.\u00a0 He also wanted to know how dilutive Mediation revenue impact its longer-term margin trajectory. The analyst flagged that consensus expectations point to Y/Y FY24E Apps segment revenue growth despite the continued degradation of its top 3 revenue-generating apps.\u00a0 He estimates revenue of $727.2 million in Q2, $733.0 million in Q3, $739.7 in Q4, and expects EBITDA of $290.8 million in Q2, $293.4 in Q3, and $295.8 in Q4.

The contacts button has been removed, and the \"End Call\" button has been placed. iOS 17 Developer Beta 5 Changes: Apple has also made a slew of other changes and additions in the latest iOS 17 developer beta 5 update as it inches closer to the final release in September. Amongst the top changes include real-time voicemail transcriptions, new contact posters which show up whenever a person in your contacts calls you, and a more refined Mental Wellbeing page with improved animations.

See Also:\u00a0Apple\u2019s Upcoming iOS 17 Update: iPhone Users Must Prepare For A Significant Change What happened:\u00a0Netflix has rolled out a new gaming app on Apple App Store that turns your iPhone screen into a gaming controller to play games on your TV\u2019s Netflix app. Users can now download the app if they own an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch running iOS 15 or later. It takes only 30MB of space. The concept of using smartphones as game controllers is not groundbreaking or new, as many other mods and emulators have been following the same to convert Android phones into game controllers for PC.\u00a0 Netflix\u2019s established subscriber base and intuitive use of a phone as a game controller may provide an edge in a successful cloud gaming launch. Where Did It Start:\u00a0In 2021, Netflix ventured into the gaming world by launching several mobile games free for subscribers, including Stranger Things: 1984 and Shooting Hoops. Since its first step into the gaming scene, the mobile game library has rapidly grown, boasting more than 63 titles in today\u2019s date. During the\u00a0TechCrunch Disrupt event\u00a0in 2022, Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu hinted at the company\u2019s exploration into cloud gaming offerings. Other giants, like Google\u2019s Stadia, have tried and failed in cloud gaming. Can Netflix succeed in this endeavor? The transition from streaming box sets to gaming seems to be seamless for Netflix. Currently, its games seem more of an extension of its features than something a user would want to use Netflix for. Only time will tell whether this strategic move into gaming will propel Netflix to greater success. Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "title": "\"A Disney Sale To Apple? Don't Count It Out This Time\" - The Hollywood Reporter",
                "body": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-apple-deal-1235559416/ \u00a0 Facing the staggering problems afflicting all legacy studios, is Bob Iger contemplating a once-unthinkable option? The signals he sent in Sun Valley suggest that it could happen. A few weeks before Bob Iger sat down for that CNBC interview in which he said\u00a0Disney\u2019s linear TV networks, like ABC and FX, \u201cmay not be core\u201d to the company\u2019s business, a veteran Hollywood executive mused to\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0on the possibility of a deal that would rock the industry:\u00a0Apple\u00a0buying Disney. It\u2019s an idea that keeps being discussed, even though many top executives have scoffed at it and many still do. Apple doesn\u2019t want to buy a studio, they say, and there\u2019s no way the feds would allow a huge deal like that to go through. But this observer wasn\u2019t so quick to rule it out. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Apple] would buy the company as it presently exists,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you see Bob start to divest things \u2026 that feels like he\u2019s prepping for a sale. And there\u2019s clearly no buyer like Apple.\u201d Not long after that, Iger went on television and hung a possibly-for-sale sign on Disney\u2019s TV businesses. And just like that, it was a little more possible to see the outlines of a slimmed-down Disney that could be a tempting acquisition target.\u00a0 There clearly is no buyer like Apple, which is sitting on $62\u00a0billion in cash and cash equivalents and has a $2.8\u00a0trillion market cap. And while it may be very true that Apple doesn\u2019t want to buy\u00a0a\u00a0studio, maybe it would want to buy\u00a0this\u00a0studio \u2014the one that, despite the challenges of the moment, has a vault full of priceless IP and remains the most valuable brand in entertainment.\u00a0 And there has been a long-standing \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Disney and Apple: Steve Jobs served on Disney\u2019s board of directors from 2006 until his death in 2011. Iger joined Apple\u2019s board shortly after Jobs died. He resigned from that position Sept.\u00a010, 2019, the same day Apple officially announced that it was getting into the content business through its Apple TV+ service.\u00a0 Some Hollywood executives have been anticipating a future in which the studio herd will continue to thin \u2014 dramatically. \u201cThere will end up being three or four platforms and everybody else gets hollowed out and acquired,\u201d says one industry veteran. \u201cThere will be Apple, Amazon, Netflix and one other. If you could put NBCUniversal, Warners and Paramount together, you probably\u202fhave enough to survive.\u201d (The\u202ffeds might have something to say about any version of that potential combination.) If Iger\u202fsees the world the same way, finding a home for Disney could be a temptation.\u00a0 \u00a0 Multiple sources say Iger, having returned to the CEO job in November, has never faced more stress. Not only is he confronting an industry in transition, but much of the team that was with him in the good years is no longer at the company: General counsel Alan Braverman and film studio chief Alan Horn have retired. CFO Christine McCarthy, having gotten a bit too close to Bob Chapek during his tenure as CEO, is gone after 23 years at the company. This may explain Iger\u2019s rapprochement with former top Disney execs Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, both of whom were passed over for CEO but who have recently been named as consultants to the company. (The two are partners in their own business, Candle Media.) They know the company well, and not only can they help figure out how to trim Disney+ costs, but they can also assist in a possible sale of the linear TV assets, including the ABC broadcast network and its eight local TV stations, as well as cable channels like Freeform and National Geographic.\u00a0 Other holdings, like Disney Channel and Disney Junior, would seem to be of minimal value without the larger company\u2019s content and backing \u2014 and FX without the programming hand of\u00a0John Landgraf and his team would seem to be devalued as well. One knowledgeable observer predicts Disney will \u201cload those assets with debt and sell to private equity.\u201d He believes the properties, which could be expected to generate $7\u00a0billion a year in profits, would sell for $50\u00a0billion. (Disney\u2019s linear networks generated $8.5\u00a0billion in profits in fiscal 2022, though that is expected to decline as cord-cutting continues.) Disney could put $25\u00a0billion of Disney debt on the deal, cutting its debt load to $20\u00a0billion. \u00a0 The company is already mulling a sale of the India businesses that it acquired from Fox. And it would not be surprising to see a sale of its majority stake in Nat Geo (perhaps in conjunction with a sale of the cable channel). Disney\u2019s 50\u00a0percent stake in A+E Networks would also likely be available to the right buyer (Hearst owns the other half). The idea that Disney might sell is top of mind for some Wall Street analysts. Needham & Co. analyst Laura Martin has contended for some time that Disney could sell to Apple. She predicts that Disney \u201cwill be purchased during the next three years,\u201d noting that takeover premiums for media companies have typically been in the 30 to 40\u00a0percent range. \u201cIf they don\u2019t sell, Disney will be competing against those [tech] companies in an industry with deteriorating economics (because they never need to make money from content), we believe,\u201d\u202fMartin wrote July\u00a014.\u00a0 In a research note in June, Martin said that Disney could give Apple the catalyst it needs to drive adoption of its forthcoming Vision Pro augmented reality headset. \u201cThe fact that Disney CEO Bob Iger was on stage touting Apple\u2019s Vision Pro goggles demonstrates the compelling strategic fit between Disney\u2019s content and Apple\u2019s wearable technology,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0 Not everyone is so bullish on a deal. Anthony Sabino, an attorney and professor at St. John\u2019s University (and a self-described \u201cinsane Disney fan\u201d), says Iger\u2019s contract extension and potential sale of Disney\u2019s linear TV assets \u201cdemonstrates that they [Disney\u2019s board] want him to guide the company, and there\u2019s no thought of him selling off the company.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 Any deal that Disney makes would be sure to invite tough scrutiny from the Biden administration, which has been aggressive in suing to prevent significant deals from being completed, albeit with mixed results.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a given, it\u2019s an absolute certainty that if there was some talk of Disney merging with somebody else, that would be scrutinized to the nth degree by the FTC, by the Department of Justice,\u201d Sabino says. \u201cSo that would be basically walking into a bear trap that I\u2019m not sure any company would be willing to get itself immersed with.\u201d A Republican administration may prove to be more lenient when it comes to a major deal (although it was the Trump administration that tried and failed to stop AT&T\u2019s acquisition\u202fof Time Warner). The actual areas of overlap between Apple and Disney are not that significant \u2014 nowhere near the overlap of, say, Disney\u2019s Fox acquisition, which took down a legacy studio. The issue would be the sheer size and power of the combined companies. But a pair of recent lawsuits, one from the FTC and another from the DOJ, could be relevant to any Disney deal. Most recently, the FTC has faltered in its efforts to block Microsoft\u2019s takeover of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard. It\u2019s a similar situation, with a tech giant and platform owner seeking to acquire what is first and foremost\u202fa content company. Microsoft preemptively promised to continue making key games available to competitors like Nintendo and Sony, a decision that was persuasive to the judge in the case, providing a possible\u202froad map for a Disney deal with a tech giant. On the other hand, the Justice Department had a big win when a judge blocked Paramount\u2019s sale of Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House in 2022. The DOJ made a \u201cmonopsony\u201d argument, namely that the merger would be harmful to authors looking to sell their work. With all the logical Disney buyers already owning their own studios, the government could make a similar case, though one source speculated that Disney could offer to preemptively divest some studio assets (like 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures) to keep the level of competition in the market stable and forestall a monopsony case.\u00a0 Loyal Disney fans, many of whom are shareholders, would be wary of a tech company\u2019s commitment to Disney\u2019s core entertainment and theme park businesses. It\u2019s a group that includes Sabino. \u201cThe uproar from Disney shareholders would be insane,\u201d he says. But with more than 1.8\u00a0billion shares outstanding, and with more than 60\u00a0percent of those shares held by institutional investors, Disney\u2019s retail shareholder fans may not have what it takes to block a deal.\u00a0 There\u2019s one person who has been thinking about a deal between Apple and Disney for years. In his 2019 memoir,\u00a0The Ride of a Lifetime, Iger wrote extensively about his friendship with Jobs, who had founded Pixar and sold it to Disney in 2006. Before there was a pandemic, before he returned from retirement to manage a Disney facing enormous challenges, Iger wrote: \u201cI believe that if Steve were still alive, we would have combined our companies, or at least discussed the possibility very seriously.\u201d\u00a0",

                "body": "Alphabet Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0Google\u00a0and\u00a0Universal Music\u00a0discussed licensing artists' melodies and voices for AI-generated songs to address the rise\u00a0of \"deepfake\" songs. They explored a partnership to develop a tool that allows fans to create AI-generated tracks and pay copyright owners legitimately, the Financial Times\u00a0reports. Warner Music Group Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:WMG) has also talked with Google about a similar product. The AI-generated songs trend resembles the early days of YouTube, when users added popular songs to their videos, leading to copyright battles and eventual agreements for compensation. The growth of AI-generated music bred concerns among celebrities about the dilution of their work and voices by fake versions. Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash, Drake, and The Weeknd had been victims of the technology. Some artists, like Grimes, have embraced AI-generated music and offered their voices for AI tracks, splitting royalties. Universal Music urged streaming platforms to prevent unauthorized AI services from using its songs. The company asked\u00a0Spotify Technology S.A.\u00a0(NYSE:SPOT) and\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) to restrict access to its music catalog for AI technology training. Google's interest in creating a music product with AI-generated songs aligns with its competition against\u00a0Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), which invested in AI company\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0and integrated AI models into its products. Google's previous preview of AI-powered music software-generated music from text descriptions and later released the experimental tool, MusicLM, in collaboration with artists.

                "body": "China is further tightening its grip on the smartphone industry. In its latest push, the Chinese government now requires app developers to either be Chinese or partner with a local publisher, apart from providing business details and a local address. What Happened: China's Ministry of Industry and Information (MIIT) has ordered app developers to file their business details, reported Reuters. The announcement also requires foreign app developers to either set up a company in China or partner with a local publisher. See Also: Why Is Apple Killing 100s Of ChatGPT-Like Apps On the Chinese App Store? In its announcement, the ministry said entities \"engaged in internet information services through apps in such fields as news, publishing, education, film and television and religion should also submit relevant documents.\" The oversight order comes into effect immediately, but app developers have a grace period until March 2024 to comply with the new rules. Failing to do so could result in the removal of their apps from app stores, fines, or both. Apple To Be Impacted: The order impacts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which currently operates the App Store in China. Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, on the other hand, has had its Play Store blocked for a long time. Until now, app developers have been able to publish apps on Apple's App Store without submitting any documentation to the Chinese government. The new rule will directly impact them and will introduce a middleman in the form of a Chinese publisher. This is not the first time China's app and game rules have impacted Apple \u2013 earlier last week, Apple pulled hundreds of ChatGPT-like apps from the App Store to comply with Chinese regulations. Back in 2020, too, Apple set a deadline for gaming apps to comply with Chinese regulations or face removal \u2013 by the end of the year, Apple ended up purging 46,000 apps in one day, and 39,000 of those apps were games.

                "body": "On July 28th, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) shares rose\u00a0soared roughly 25% upon the release of second quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.\u00a0On Monday after the bell, Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) also topped second quarter revenue and earnings estimates despite a challenging TV advertising market and streaming losses, with shares rising 7% in after-hours trading. Therefore, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is in for a lot of pressure as today\u2019s report will make it either the streaming king or yet another struggling streaming player.\u00a0 Roku reports its sales expanded 11% YoY to $847 million but it still made a GAAP loss of $108 million, improving slightly from 2022\u2019s comparable quarter when it lost $112 million.\u00a0Considering that its active accounts rose 16% YoY to 73.5 million, with streaming hours increasing 21% YoY to 25.1 billion,\u00a0Roku is well positioned to reaccelerate growth once ad spending rebounds. Paramount narrowed down its direct-to-consumer loss of $424 million with linear ad revenue contracting 10% YoY. Overall, it made $7.62 billion in revenue, topping analyst estimates of $7.43 billion but still below last year\u2019s comparable quarter when it made $7.8 billion in sales. It made an operating loss of $250 million which is a far cry from 2022\u2019s comparable quarter when it made an operating profit of $819 million. Adjusted EPS amounted to $0.10 a share. Management is still expecting to see improving conditions during the remaining half of the year.\u00a0 Paramount\u00a0CEO Bob Bakish expressed his sadness due to the ongoing double strike that began due to failed negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which acts on behalf of studios that include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Disney, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others. Bakish acknowledged that the partnership with the creative community is critical for the health of the industry. But for now, uncertainties remain with filming and release schedules being postponed as a consequence. Disney is gearing up to report its fiscal third quarter earnings after the bell amid a challenging year. The entertainment giant has been facing a slowdown in streaming but until now, Disney CEO Bob Iger has maintained that the unit will reach profitability in 2024. Advertising remains a headwind, and the ongoing strike a massive headache for the media giant. Today\u2019s report along with Iger\u2019s vision for going forward will ultimately tell if struggling Disney has a shot of getting to the ball or its carriage has turned to a pumpkin.

                "title": "Hyped About iPhone 15? Sony Isn't \u2013 The Lens Maker Expects Apple's New iPhone Won't Be In High Demand",
                "body": "Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 launch is just a few weeks away. Amidst the increasing hype in the run up to the launch, lens maker Sony isn't very optimistic about iPhone 15 demand. What Happened: Sony, the dominant smartphone lens maker, is forecasting lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 15 as the world goes through an economic downturn. See Also: iPhone 15 Launch Likely On September 12: Thinner Bezels, Periscope Camera And Action Button, Everything We Know So Far In its latest earnings call, Sony said that the smartphone sensor business is now expected to recover in 2024, at least, instead of the previous projection of a recovery in late 2023. \"The recovery of the smartphone market in China is slower than we expected and conditions in the US market are worsening,\" said Sadahiko Hayakawa, a senior general manager for finance at Sony. Although Sony did not specify iPhone 15 in particular, Apple's upcoming flagship is the only major smartphone launch for the rest of the year. For context, iPhone sales have been lower than normal this year \u2013 in the US, iPhone shipments fell by 6% year-on-year in the June quarter. However, the trends for everyone else are worse, with overall smartphone shipments falling by 24%. iPhone 15 Demand To Be Lower Than iPhone 14: Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also projected the demand for iPhone 15 to be lower than that of the iPhone 14. In fact, Kuo expects Apple's hardware sales in the rest of 2023 to be lower than last year's. \"Unless the demand for the iPhone 15 is better than market expectations after launch, most of the suppliers will face growth pressure in 2H23 as the demand for iPhone 15 is lower than that of iPhone 14,\" Kuo noted. This is despite the iPhone 15 shaping up to be the biggest upgrade in years, with thinner bezels, improved cameras and design, denser batteries, and more sizing up to be a considerable upgrade.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, and TSLA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: Currently, SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is trading above our pivotal point at 449.42. Should this level remain robust today, we anticipate the bulls aiming for 450.23, with sustained buying potentially reaching 451.01. Our optimistic target for the day stands at 451.61. Conversely, if 449.42 faces a downward pressure due to intense selling, we foresee a bearish move towards 447.94. A breach of this level could further push the price to 446.31, with our most bearish target set at 445.08. At present, the Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) are trading below our crucial mark of 372.91. If the bulls can regain this level and establish it as a solid support, our initial target is 373.82. With added momentum, we could see 375.18 and 375.98. Our top bullish target today is 377.58. Should the price struggle to maintain above 372.91, we expect the bears to dominate, pulling the price to 371.96. A further decline could lead to 370.91, and with significant selling pressure, our most bearish target is 370.08. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading above our significant level of 180.60. If this holds, our upward target is 181.25. If the bulls dominate, we're eyeing 182.27 as the day's peak. However, if 180.60 faces a downward shift, the bears might aim for 179.36, with a further decline potentially reaching 178.61. Our most bearish target today is 177.31. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading beneath our key point of 328.52. For bullish action, we're looking at reclaiming 328.52, with strong buying potentially touching 331.24. Our top bullish target is 333.46. If 328.52 remains unattained, the bears might push towards 326.05. With intense selling, our most bearish target for Microsoft today is 323.17. Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) is trading above our pivotal point of 250.25. If this remains consistent, the bulls might aim for 252.38. With strong buying, our top target for the day is 254.28. On the flip side, if 250.25 faces a decline due to intense selling, we anticipate a move towards 248.37, with our most bearish target set at 246.16.

The news is that China has entered deflation.\u00a0In The Arora Report analysis, it is nowhere near as bad as the headline appears for the following reasons.\u00a0\u00a0 Chinese exports fell by 14.5% year-over-year vs. 12.5% consensus.\u00a0Exports to the\u00a0U.S. fell by 23%.\u00a0Exports to the E.U. and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations fell by 21%.\u00a0These are the biggest drops since the start of the pandemic.\u00a0Since China is the factory to the world, this indicates that the consumer demand for goods is falling.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is neutral but expect the market to open higher.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\u00a0To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0 If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

What Happened: According to a Bloomberg Law\u00a0report, the Supreme Court ruled\u00a0that Apple can maintain its current payment rules in its App Store.\u00a0 Earlier this year, the Court of Appeals said that Apple violated unfair competition laws by limiting payment methods for app developers, including purchases in the\u00a0Epic Games Store. The report indicates that Justice Elena\u00a0Kagan put the federal appeals\u00a0court decision on hold without explanation.\u00a0 Apple previously disputed the appeals court\u00a0ruling and argued\u00a0Epic\u00a0wasn't being impacted by its policies. Epic Games, who owns Fortnite, reportedly \"created a workaround\" to avoid paying 30% fees on in-app purchases from its customers. Apple then removed Fortnite from the App Store.\u00a0 The ruling is a win for Apple, but it appears it could only be a temporary one.\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0Hyped About iPhone 15?

                "body": "Recent media reports that TSMC is not asking Apple to pay for the cost of defective 3nm chips are different from my understanding. There are two ways that customers buy chips from TSMC: finished goods buy and wafer buy. The vast majority of deals are wafer-buy because TSMC's yields are good enough to ignore the cost of defective chips. But Apple is a special case. Apple has always asked TSMC to provide the world's latest advanced node production services. Because the latest advanced node has many defective chips in the early stage of production, Apple has always purchased finished goods. And TSMC allocates most of the cost of defective chips to the selling price of each finished chip. The best evidence is that the cost of the new processor used in new iPhones increases significantly every year, and this year's A17 is no exception.",

                "title": "CPI Inflation Data Hits Thursday: 5 ETFs With Potential For Wild Market Moves",
                "body": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 long-awaited July Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is scheduled to be released on Thursday at 8:30 a.m., ahead of the opening bell. This critical economic data will have a significant impact on market expectations for future Fed rate hikes. Therefore, market fluctuations could be anticipated if inflation data surprises\u00a0expectations.\u00a0 Currently, there is widespread consensus around the Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates unchanged in September, with a market-based probability standing at 85%, according to CME Group. The likelihood of rates staying unchanged also in the November meeting drops to 71%, still reflecting a substantial majority in this regard. Economists anticipate that the annual inflation rate will rise from 3% to 3.3% in July, snapping a streak of 12 consecutive declines. This is mainly due to the so-called base effect, which Benzinga recently explained in an article where we also gathered some analysts\u2019 forecasts. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food and is closely monitored by the Fed to gauge underlying price pressures in the economy, is expected to remain steady at 4.8% year-over-year in July. Both inflation measures are projected to advance at a monthly rate of 0.2%. Also Read: Goldman Sachs Was Right About Lucid And Celsius: Why Plug Power Stock Could Be The Next \u2018Earnings-Day Short Squeeze\u2019 Let\u2019s focus on five exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that could experience significant fluctuations if tomorrow\u2019s data differs from economists\u2019 expectations. The VIXY ETF, designed to mirror the performance of the VIX Short-Term Futures Index, aims to offer investors a means to tap into volatility without engaging in direct options trading. Higher-than-expected inflation can disrupt a market that largely believes the Fed will keep rates steady in September, thereby potentially increasing market volatility. The VIXY ETF is down 55% year-to-date, but last week marked its second-best week of the year, surging by 12%.  2. Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSE:VUG) Growth stocks have been on the rise in 2023, with the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSE:VUG) up 35% year-to-date, the move higher has been closely linked to the decline in consumer inflation. The drop in inflation has eased concerns of excessive hikes by the Federal Reserve, causing the market to start pricing in rate cuts for 2024. This has provided significant relief to stocks highly sensitive to future interest rates. However, a resurgence in price pressures could potentially slow down or reverse the trajectory that growth stocks have been following thus far.  3. ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARK) Due to its investment focus on innovative and high-growth companies, particularly in sectors like technology, healthcare, and disruptive industries, the ARK Innovation ETF is also highly sensitive to inflation data and thus rate expectations.  Many of Cathie Wood\u2018s ARKK investments\u00a0rely on borrowing to support their research, development, and expansion. Funding those activities\u00a0becomes more expensive when interest rates rise, dampening the growth forecast for these companies.\u00a0 A reemergence of inflationary pressures could potentially place some downward pressure on the ARK Innovation ETF, which has returned 36% year to date. 4. Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF (NYSE:FCPI) This ETF, launched and managed by Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, invests in stocks that may be better positioned to perform well during inflationary periods.  Its largest holdings include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) As inflation tumbled in 2023, the Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF trailed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) by 7%. If inflation returns, we can anticipate this underperformance to come to a halt, if not reverse. 5. Simplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF (NYSE:PFIX) The ETF, operated by Simplify Asset Management Inc., engages in direct and derivative investments in various U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and investment grade bonds with different maturity dates. The primary objective of this ETF is to provide investors with a safeguard against potential increases in interest rates. Notably, during the period between March 14, 2022, and October 25, 2022, the Simplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF experienced a remarkable 100% increase in value. This gain was propelled by the Federal Reserve\u2019s notably aggressive monetary policy tightening during that time. Should inflation once again experience an upswing, the demand for instruments designed to hedge against interest rate fluctuations is also likely to surge.

                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had a key legal victory as the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the company about its anti-steering rules, which prevent app developers from directing consumers to alternate payment methods. What Happened: Supreme Court Judge Elena Kagan on Wednesday declined to vacate a stay on a lower court order concerning the anti-steering rules in a lawsuit brought by Fortnite developer Epic Games. After the District Court ordered that Apple violated California's Unfair Competition Law with its anti-steering rules, the Ninth Circuit of Appeals ordered a stay on this part of the ruling in July. Epic sought to vacate the stay because the ruling will impact not only Epic but also consumers and other developers. If the payment is moved out of the App Store, developers can escape a fee Apple charges but Cupertino reserved the right to charge a commission separately if developers frequently adopt the practice.

The fund manager sees two benefits for Apple from the ruling. This will help Apple to maintain App Store revenue because it continues developers' challenges in steering customers away from Apple's payment system, he said. The ruling also reduces the chances that Apple will be forced to make changes to App Store policy or take the rate down the road, he added. App Store is part of Apple's Services business, which was the start of the June quarter results. The company's quarterly outperformance came mainly due to record revenue earned by the business. Apple ended Wednesday's session down 0.90% at $178.19 amid the broader market weakness but added a modest 0.13% to $178.43 in the after-hours session, according to Benzinga Pro data.

                "body": "The iPhone 15 Pro has been rumored to be powered by the next-generation 3-nanometer Apple A17 Bionic chip. Now, a new rumor suggests that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could pack in an extra GPU core, bumping up the performance over its predecessor. What Happened: According to a new rumor by leaker @URedditor, the iPhone 15 Pro's A17 Bionic chip is expected to feature an extra GPU core, while the CPU's clock speed could be bumped up. See Also: iPhone 15 Launch Likely On September 12: Thinner Bezels To Periscope Camera And Action Button, Everything We Know So Far The leaker in question has a decent track record with Apple leaks, so there is some credence to this new leak. The A17 Bionic chip is expected to power the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, while the standard iPhone 15 models will likely feature last year's A16 Bionic chip. While this segregation is not new, we now have some finer details about what the A17 Bionic chip could offer. The leak suggests that in terms of CPU performance, the A17 Bionic chip could offer a 15-20% increase in performance over the A16 Bionic. On the graphics front, Apple is reportedly throwing in an extra GPU core, which should help increase the performance. On the other hand, TSMC's 3nm node should help maintain the performance without impacting efficiency. Same RAM As iPhone 14 Pro: Alongside this, the leaker also says that the iPhone 15 Pro could have 6GB of RAM, the same as the iPhone 14 Pro. Previous reports had suggested that we could see 8GB of RAM on the iPhone 15 Pro, but this leaker counteracts those reports, saying they have \"only seen 6GB so far\". However, they note that 8GB is not entirely impossible, so we must wait and watch how it unfolds. The iPhone 15 launch event is expected to be on September 12, aligning with previous reports of US carriers asking their employees to be in attendance for a \"major smartphone launch\".

                "body": "While there are rumors that the upcoming Apple Watch Series 9 will not bring any significant upgrade this time, whisperings from the tech community hint that a new watch band might steal the spotlight at Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) September event. Apple's new wearables are expected to bring a dash of extra speed from a new chip, a new pink variant for Series 9, and a broody black for Ultra 2, but the real zest might be in the band. Apple seems to be upping its wrist game to make these watches cosmetically more appealing. See Also: iPhone 15 Pro To See A Performance Boost Thanks To This A17 Bionic Chip Feature What Happened: According to Kosutami on Twitter, Apple will debut a new watch band this time. The new strap will reportedly feature \u201cweaved fabric materials and a magnetic buckle.\u201d #Apple will release a new \uf8ffWatch band with weaved fabric materials and magnetic buckle (might like Modern Buckle Leather Band one) this year later with new watch. (Photo only for concept looks)#appleinternal @markgurman @URedditor @ProfessorTox pic.twitter.com/9wD75v6go5 A sleek strap touted to feature woven fabric materials and a magnetic buckle is said to be new to the party this time. If that rings a bell, it sounds eerily similar to the Modern Buckle band from 2015. Despite being loved by many, it bid us farewell in 2018 (we never really got a reason), and the style world has beckoned it back. But hold onto your hats because September promises a whirlwind of Apple surprises. With the iPhone 15 and new Apple Watches on the horizon, this blast from the past band might be the sweet nudge for those contemplating if it\u2019s upgrade time. It would be better if these bands are backward compatible with older Apple Watches, which seems likely if the rumors are true.

                "body": "Rumors of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) buying Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) has surfaced on and off, and following the latter's quarterly results an analyst said it's unlikely the tech giant pursues the Mouse House. What Happened: \u201cOur view continues to be that Apple will not buy Disney, given strategically it would not fit in Apple's ecosystem,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. The analyst, however, thinks the Tim Cook-led company could be interested in Disney's ESPN division. \u201cThat said, we strongly believe if Iger/Board decided to sell ESPN this would be a highly attractive asset for APPL on sports content front Cook would pursue,\u201d he said. See Also: Best Media Diversified Stocks Why It's Important: Disney is struggling with an uncertain economic recovery, which has impacted its theme park attendance. The loss of appeal for linear TV and the competitive threat in the streaming business have all weighed down on the company and in turn, its stock price. The company on Wednesday reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share but revenue and Disney+ total subscriptions trailed expectations. The company's ESPN recently announced a sports betting partnership with Penn Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN). Needham analysts Laura Martin has more than once raised the possibility of an Apple-Disney combination and concluded both would be better off together. For Apple, a potential ESPN buy could mean bolstering its sports coverage. In June 2022, the company struck a 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer for streaming all MLS matches worldwide, beginning in 2023. In premarket trading on Thursday, Disney rose 1.38% to $88.70, and Apple gained 0.25% to $178.64, according to Benzinga Pro data.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, and TSLA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is trending above our pivotal 447.94 mark. Should it maintain this stance, we anticipate a bullish move towards 449.42, with further momentum potentially reaching 450.23 and 451.01. Our optimistic target for today stands at 451.61. Conversely, if 447.94 faces a downturn due to strong selling, we predict a bearish descent to 446.31. A breach of this level could further push it to 445.08. In the event of intense selling today, our pessimistic target is 443.90. Currently, QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ)\u00a0is trading below the crucial 370.91 level. If bulls manage to secure this level, our sights are set on 371.96, with sustained momentum possibly touching 372.91 and 373.82. Our top bullish target today is 375.18. Should 370.91 prove unstable today, we expect a bearish pull towards 370.08. A further decline could see levels of 369.39 and 368.57. In a heavy sell-off scenario, our bearish target is 367.52. Apple's\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) trading is favoring our 178.61 benchmark. If this remains consistent, our bullish target is 179.36, with an optimistic outlook of 180.60. A downturn from 178.61 could see a bearish move to 177.31. In the event of a significant sell-off, our bearish target is 176.29. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading beneath our 326.05 marker. Bulls would aim to surpass 326.05, with strong buying potentially reaching 328.52. Our top bullish expectation today is 331.24. If 326.05 remains unattained, a bearish trend towards 323.17 is anticipated. In a heavy selling scenario, our bearish target stands at 321.51. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) is trading below our 308.16 benchmark. Bulls will aim to surpass this, with strong momentum potentially touching 309.51. Continued bullish activity could reach 311.42, with an optimistic target of 314.41. Should 308.16 remain elusive, a bearish move towards 304.77 is expected. In a significant sell-off scenario, our bearish target is 301.71. Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) is favoring our 243.98 benchmark. If this trend persists, we're eyeing a bullish move to 246.16, with strong momentum potentially reaching 248.37. Our top bullish target is 250.25. A decline from 243.98 could see a bearish trend towards 242.47. In a heavy selling scenario, our bearish target is 238.50.

                "title": "'See Reason For Owning Disney': Analysts Assess DTC Growth And PENN Sports Betting Deal",
                "body": "Media giant The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) reported third quarter financial results after market close Wednesday. The company missed revenue estimates and beat earnings per share estimates from analysts in the quarter. Here's a look at what analysts are saying after the results. The Disney Analysts: Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen has a Neutral rating and a price target of $94. Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett has a Buy rating and lowers the price target from $111 to $102. Needham analyst Laura Martin has a Hold rating and no price target. Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne has an Overweight rating and a price target of $105. Macquarie on Disney: Results for Disney were mixed, but there is a lot going on for the future, Nollen said. \u201cDTC was mixed: core Disney+ subs were only +800k while D+/Hotstar dropped 12.5m, but operating losses improved $150m q/1 to -$512 million vs guidance implying -$750m,\u201d Nollen said. The analyst said several initiatives are coming from Disney to boost the direct-to-consumer segment, including ad tiers rolled out in Canada in November, price increases on ad-free plans, password-sharing crackdowns and new bundles set to be introduced. Rosenblatt on Disney: A partnership between Disney and PENN Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN) could be \u201cjust a taste of what could come\u201d for the media giant, according to Crockett. \u201cWe retain a Buy rating and see reason for owning Disney,\u201d Crockett said. The analyst pointed out that the company's shift in strategic focus has left ESPN flagging, while identifying other segments as potential growth drivers for the company in the future. \u201cDisney\u2019s deal to enter sports betting via a deal with Penn Entertainment, which will pay $1.5B in fees over 10 years, is interesting mainly as a way to spruce up ESPN betting capabilities, which appeals to a younger generation.\u201d Crockett said Disney CEO Bob Iger made a point of discussing a strategic partner to help with distribution, content and technology, which could signal interest from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). The analyst said guidance from the company \u201cseems beatable\u201d if it hits its goals for direct-to-consumer. \u201cThis could be the low watermark, with upside strategically and versus cautious guidance.\u201d Related Link: Trading Strategies For Disney Stock After Q3 Earnings\u00a0 Needham on Disney: Lower content spending for Disney, in part related to the Hollywood strike, could be a positive for the company, Martin acknowledged. \u201cThis FCF will repay DIS\u2019s debt faster, and/or reinstate the dividend. Both are positives for DIS shareholders, in our view,\u201d Martin said. Martin said Disney is focused on driving higher direct-to-consumer margins, with another price increase coming for Disney+ to drive subscriptions into the ad-supported tier, \u201cwhich has higher economics.\u201d The analyst said movie box office performance from Disney has been weak and is looking for more in the second half of the year. Martin added that customer acquisition costs could fall with strong original blockbuster movies. \u201cOur Hold rating on DIS is based on our belief that consensus estimates for DIS are too high owing to DTC losses and another year of weak earnings from linear TV and box office.\u201d Martin sees Disney as a takeover target in the future due to its strong position in the streaming sector, and having a library of hit film and television franchises that is \u201cbest in class.\u201d \u201cWe believe that high quality content libraries with hit film and TV franchises will be revalued upward as competing new technologies scale and becomes more widely adopted over time. No company has better fan-driven IP than DIS, in our view.\u201d Morgan Stanley on Disney: Disney is not sitting still moving forward, Swinburne said. \u201cDisney continues to benefit from the profitable growth of its Parks segment, which we see driving consolidated earnings and FCF growth for years to come,\u201d Swinburne said. The analyst said the company is working to continue growth for its direct-to-consumer business and expects to report higher Disney+ net adds in the fourth quarter than what it has reported in recent quarters. \u201cWe look to new segment reporting including standalone ESPN financials for the first time later this Fall and Disney\u2019s upcoming investor day in mid-September as upcoming catalysts.\u201d DIS Price Action: Disney shares are up 3% to $90.18\u00a0at the time of publication\u00a0Thursday, versus a 52-week trading range of $84.08 to $126.48 Read Next: Disney Box Office Troubles: Will 2023 Be The First Year Since 2014 To Miss This Major Milestone?\u00a0 Photo: Shutterstock",

Note the following: Given the backdrop of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, China and Russia joined together to make an audacious move. The largest ever warship group from the Chinese and Russian navies approached Alaska in a provocative move.\u00a0To counter Chinese and Russian moves, the\u00a0U.S. sent four navy warships to the same waters. This incident is a further reaffirmation that our prior major call is correct.\u00a0The major call is that the four megatrends that drove the 40 year secular bull market from 1982 to 2022 have ended.\u00a0One of the megatrends that has ended is lower defense spending, which helped stock markets throughout the world.\u00a0Going forward, the highest probability is of cyclical bull markets and cyclical bear markets.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is neutral but expect the market to open higher as investors buy stocks pumped over the weekend.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\u00a0To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "body": "Benchmark\u00a0analyst\u00a0Mark Zgutowicz\u00a0maintained\u00a0AppLovin Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:APP) with a Sell and raised the\u00a0price target from $17 to $22. He continues to weigh the sustainability of near-term Software Platform (SP) momentum, specifically efficacy-led growth, and secular industry concerns, including Apple\u2019s next shot across the MAX mediation bow with fingerprinting.\u00a0 Management credited most, if not all, recent SP momentum to AXON 2.0 efficacy improvements vs. macro lift, and he continue to assess the sustainability and magnitude of forward efficacy revenue momentum. He acknowledges that its mediation business is a competitive data play under developer confinements to MAX API.\u00a0 However, uncapped efficacy gains are questionable in an industry burdened with duplicative behavioral targeting. His big picture concern surrounds\u00a0Apple Inc\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) expanding interest in/outside attribution, or more specifically, its ads long game, to route traffic to a single (Apple) server.\u00a0 He expects FY23 revenue of $3.05 billion (prior $2.92 billion) and FY24 revenue of $3.11 billion (prior $2.93 billion). Wedbush\u00a0analyst\u00a0Nick McKay\u00a0maintained an Outperform and raised the price target from $37 to $48. AppLovin\u2019s positive momentum\u00a0continued into Q223, with the rollout of its AXON 2.0 machine learning technology contributing to a record performance for the high-margin Software Platform business.\u00a0 At a high level, the technology has enabled more ad spend efficiency for customers (as promised), primarily mobile game developers for the time being, through enhanced targeting of transaction-based customers reflected by higher revenue per installation, which increased by 38% in the quarter.\u00a0 He expects Q323 to benefit from the first full quarter of AXON 2.0 contribution and views the guidance for the period within reach. Sequential Software Platform revenue growth of around 14% for Q2:23 was primarily a reflection of AXON 2.0.\u00a0 He remains optimistic about AppLovin\u2019s opportunities to expand beyond its core market and into non-gaming verticals, helped by its new technology, which is not limited to mobile gaming applications, unlike its predecessor.\u00a0 Better ad spend outcomes will no longer restrict to mobile games in future years, and AppLovin has been able to attract a broader array of ad customers due to AXON 2.0\u2019s advancements. He expects FY23 revenue of $3.10 billion (prior $2.97 billion) and FY24 revenue of $3.60 billion (prior $3.35 billion). Credit Suisse\u00a0analyst\u00a0Stephen Ju\u00a0maintained an Outperform and raised the price target from $49 to $57. The re-rating reflects operations in the fastest-growing segment in video games, software to offer more diversified exposure to mobile games, secular growth theme, and optionality to expand TAM to non-gaming apps.\u00a0 Outperformance on revenue and adjusted EBITDA vs. consensus was due to the software, which accelerated to grow 28% YOY and accounted for 54% of the revenue mix (vs. 2Q22 41%).\u00a0 The company launched Axon 2.0 in the quarter and, similar to its predecessor, helped drive the rising accuracy of ads to deliver higher ROAS.\u00a0 The design of Axon 2.0 to support the ad market more generally vs. just mobile games validates his thesis for expanding ad dollar TAM to the overall ad market. And as AppLovin continues to update and iterate, it should continue to drive ROAS improvement, and hence Axon 2.0 benefits should continue. And this benefit helped to drive Software Adj. EBITDA margin to 67%. Price Action:\u00a0APP shares closed higher by 26.50% to $37.20 on Thursday.",

                "body": "Earlier this week, a family trapped amidst the raging wildfires in Maui was successfully rescued, thanks to the Emergency SOS via Satellite feature on Apple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) flagship smartphone iPhone 14. What Happened: As the wildfires intensified around them, five individuals found themselves stranded in a vehicle in an area devoid of cell phone service. However, one of them had an iPhone 14, which proved to be a lifesaver.  A post on X.com by Michael J. Miraflor shared the ordeal his brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s cousin and his family went through while being in a vehicle surrounded by a sudden eruption of wildfire around them. My brother's girlfriend's cousin and his family were caught in their vehicle in Maui while the wildfires suddenly erupted around them. No cell service, so Apple Emergency SOS was the only way they could get in contact with first responders. Literally saved their lives. pic.twitter.com/PpxNwTGOAf The device\u2019s Emergency SOS via Satellite feature enabled them to contact first responders, 9to5Mac reports.  This feature, introduced by Apple with the iPhone 14, allows users to reach out to emergency services in areas without cellular connectivity. In this instance, the iPhone relayed the family\u2019s dire situation and location to a relay center, which then informed the fire department. Approximately 30 minutes later, the family was rescued.

Amidst such calamities, technological advancements like the iPhone\u2019s Emergency SOS via Satellite feature play a crucial role in ensuring safety and timely rescues. In December, it was reported that the feature saved the life of a man who was stranded in a remote area of Alaska. Furthermore, companies like Verizon Communications are stepping up by offering relief to affected customers in Maui, waiving call/text/data usage incurred from Aug. 10 to Aug. 23, 2023, as mentioned in a press statement.

                "body": "Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is borrowing a leaf out of Apple's playbook. It is working on a new feature that makes it easy for users with multiple Android devices to manage calls seamlessly. What Happened: Google is working on a new feature that will let users seamlessly switch between Android devices for managing calls, similar to the Call Continuity feature on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices. See Also: Stealthy Invaders Beware: Here\u2019s How You Can Detect Unknown Trackers With Your Android Phone Spotted by Android researcher Nail Sadykov (via Mishaal Rehman), this feature is a part of Google Play Services, so it's not completely dependent on the phone's Android version. This means that most Android phones will be able to access this feature even if their phone maker has stopped updating it. You may soon be able to \"link your [Android] devices\" signed into the same Google account together. This will enable \"call switching\", which lets you switch between devices for calls, as well as \"Internet sharing\"!H/T @Nail_Sadykov pic.twitter.com/WCunYNE9GQ Simply named \u2018Call switching', when enabled, users will be able to seamlessly switch between multiple linked Android devices to make or accept voice calls on their phone number. How Is It Helpful: Imagine you have two Android phones but only one SIM card. While this is placed in your primary phone, you can link your secondary phone with the primary one using the same Google account. This will allow you to accept calls on the secondary phone, which can be useful when the primary phone is out of your reach or is charging, for instance. If this sounds familiar, that is because Apple has a feature called \u2018Call Continuity' that works seamlessly between Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. While Google has never had as cohesive an ecosystem as Apple, this new \u2018Call switching' and \u2018Link Your Devices' feature is definitely a step in this direction. Other companies like Samsung have done their bit to make their own tablets, phones, and smartwatches talk to each other, but a native Android solution will benefit the entire Android ecosystem.

                "body": "Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) instant messaging platform,\u00a0WhatsApp, has unleashed\u00a0a slew of new features\u00a0that directly challenge the dominance of\u00a0Zoom Video Communication\u00a0(NASDAQ:ZM),\u00a0Microsoft Corp\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0Teams\u00a0and\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0Google Meet.\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0WhatsApp\u00a0seems to be gearing up for a showdown\u00a0with industry giants by introducing a feature that promises to transform how group voice calls are orchestrated.\u00a0 Drawing inspiration from productivity powerhouses like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp is rolling out the ability to schedule voice calls within group chats,\u00a0reported\u00a0WaBetaInfo.\u00a0 The scheduling feature is already in the beta testing phase. People using WhatsApp\u2019s Android beta version 2.23.17.7 may explore this call-scheduling feature, which enables users to arrange calls and provide advance notifications to group members. See Also:\u00a0WhatsApp Scrambles To Clear The Air After Elon Musk Says Meta\u2019s Messaging Service \u2018Cannot Be Trusted\u2019 How To Schedule Voice Calls:\u00a0Within a group chat, users can now tap on the phone icon, revealing a menu that offers the option to select a specific date and time for a forthcoming call. Then, an invitation is swiftly dispatched to the entire group, ensuring that participants are informed well in advance.\u00a0 Notably, those who decide to join the scheduled call receive a convenient reminder 15 minutes before the appointed time, guaranteeing punctuality and engagement. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0Earlier this week, WhatsApp introduced another major feature \u2013 screen sharing. This strategic move places WhatsApp in direct competition with the video conferencing titans, including Microsoft Meet, Google Meet, and even\u00a0Apple Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0FaceTime. A simple tap on the \u201cShare\u201d icon opens up a world of options, empowering users to share specific applications or their entire screen. While initially available to select beta testers on Android, WhatsApp\u2019s screen-sharing\u00a0feature is set to sweep across platforms, including Android,\u00a0iOS, and Windows Desktop.\u00a0 Meta\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0introduced this feature through his social media channels, underscoring its importance in the grand scheme of things. Additionally, WhatsApp has also unveiled Landscape mode for video calls.\u00a0 Image: Shutterstock/ Antonio Salaverry Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Months after industry giants like\u00a0Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd\u00a0(OTC:SSNLF),\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), and\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reportedly\u00a0clamped down on the internal use\u00a0of AI-powered chatbots, a surprising trend has emerged \u2014 the widespread embrace of\u00a0ChatGPT, developed by\u00a0OpenAI, in workplaces across the U.S.\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0In May, almost a month after\u00a0Samsung reportedly faced an issue\u00a0regarding a confidential information leak, the South Korean giant imposed an internal ban on employees\u2019 use of popular generative AI tools, setting a precedent. Apple and Google followed suit, aiming to safeguard intellectual property and sensitive data.\u00a0 However, a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted between July 11 and 17 suggests that OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT\u2019s allure remains undeniable. See Also:\u00a0ChatGPT\u2019s Website Sees A Dip In Visitors: Is The World Already Tired Of Chatting With AI? The online survey showed that 28% of people use ChatGPT regularly at work, but only 22% mentioned that their employers officially allowed using external tools like the popular chatbot.\u00a0 The survey by Reuters/Ipsos included 2,625 adults in the U.S.\u00a0 The appeal of ChatGPT lies in its adaptability and convenience. Users have turned to the chatbot for various tasks, from creating humorous team event invitations to crafting farewell emails and aiding in general research.\u00a0 However, this surge in usage has raised concerns about data security and privacy. OpenAI\u2019s assurance that corporate data won\u2019t be further used for\u00a0training without permission\u00a0is intended to alleviate these concerns, but it remains to be seen whether such reassurances will mitigate the hesitations of security-conscious firms. While a blanket ban might not be warranted yet, the rising popularity of ChatGPT underscores the need for organizations to tread carefully, balancing the potential benefits of AI-assisted productivity with the imperative of safeguarding proprietary information, reported Reuters.\u00a0 Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0In March this year,\u00a0Italy banned the use of ChatGPT\u00a0due to privacy concerns, becoming the first Western country to do so. However, the country has since revoked the decision.\u00a0 Image Credits \u2013 Shutterstock Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12.

The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0 If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY)\u00a0is aiming to reclaim our pivotal 445.08 mark. Should it maintain above this today, bulls might set their sights on 446.31. With sustained buying momentum, we anticipate a surge to 447.94, with an optimistic target of 449.42. Conversely, if 445.08 faces a downturn with significant selling, we foresee a bearish move towards 443.90 and then 443.42. A breach of this crucial range could lead to a dip to 442.61. In the event of intense selling, our bearish floor is 442.04. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) are hovering just above our 366.69 benchmark. If this level remains resilient, bulls might target 367.52, with potential ascents to 368.57 and 369.39. The day's bullish peak is set at 370.08. However, if the 369.69 mark falters, a bearish descent to 366.15 is anticipated. A further decline could see 365.59, with a bearish extreme at 364.65. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading above our 177.31 threshold. If this holds, an upward move to 178.61 is likely, with a bullish zenith at 179.36. A breach below 177.31 could see bears eyeing 176.29, with a potential floor at 175.09. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) has slipped past our 321.51 support. Bulls would aim to recover this, potentially targeting 323.17, with an optimistic ceiling at 326.05. If 321.51 remains elusive, bears might push towards 320.05, with a pessimistic base at 318.48. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) trades beneath our 304.77 marker. Bulls would aim to surpass this, with a potential surge to 308.16 and an optimistic target at 309.51. Failing to surpass 304.77 could see a bearish move to 301.71, with a floor at 300.23. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is trading below our 419.39 benchmark. If this persists, bears might target 413.76, with a bearish nadir at 409.31. A recovery above 419.36 could see a bullish move to 421.35, with a peak at 424.83. Final Word: Today's focus will be on the market's reaction to the hotter-than-expected PPI data. Expect heightened volatility; stay alert and trade wisely. Best of luck!

                "title": "WeWork Shares Rocket And Get The Meme-Stock Treatment: Did Streaming Networks Attacking Company Inspire A Rally Cry?",
                "body": "Shares of coworking office space company WeWork Inc (NYSE:WE) have been incredibly volatile over the last week, following an update from the company that\u00a0rattled the stock. After shares fell sharply, retail traders got behind the stock and could be trying to push shares back over $1. What Happened: It\u2019s not everyday that investors see a company once valued at $47 billion hit a market capitalization closer to $250 million. It\u2019s also rare to see a company that was once valued at $47 billion to have shares\u00a0pop 130% during a trading day. A filing from the company earlier in the week warned investors that the company had concerns about its liquidity. WeWork ended the second quarter with $680 million in liquidity, which included $205 million in cash. \u201cThe company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management\u2019s plan to improve liquidity and profitability over the next 12 months,\u201d the filing read. In 2010,\u00a0Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey founded the company by buying up office space and renting it out to customers. The company has faced struggles in recent years due to a push to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. WeWork also saw the exit\u00a0of Neumann as the company\u2019s CEO and allegations over a frat like culture and discrimination based on sex and race. At its peak, WeWork was valued at $47 billion. The company was set for a highly anticipated IPO\u00a0but started to see its value drop over concerns at the company. A SPAC deal announced in 2021 valued the coworking company at $9 billion, a far cry from the $47 billion. Related Link: Infamous WeWork Co-Founder Launches New Venture\u00a0 Reddit Takes Hold: A spark in WeWork shares could likely be attributed to\u00a0a thread on Reddit posted on Wednesday that inspired\u00a0an investment case for the stock. As Benzinga previously reported, a post on X, also compared WeWork to GameStop and may have inspired investors to consider the stock before the post was taken down. The post\u00a0showed the stock chart of WeWork, which was down 98% from its IPO. Reddit user u/lostredditacc posted\u00a0\u201cWeWork $1.00 price target ETA 7-8 weeks\u201d as a due-diligence post on the popular social platform. To kick off the post, the user wrote,\u00a0\u201cWeWork (2021-Hulu), WeCrashed (2022-Apple), WeSoBack (2023-Netflix?).\u201d The post suggests\u00a0a\u00a0role that streaming companies played in WeWork's downfall and potentially bringing the company into the meme stock realm with the rally cry. WeWork was the subject of a documentary on Hulu. The documentary was titled \u201cWeWork or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn.\u201d The film premiered at the South by Southwest festival in 2021 and went on to win an Emmy Award. It\u00a0focused heavily on Neumann. In 2022, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) released \u201cWeCrashed\u201d as a series on its AppleTV+ streaming platform. The series consisted of eight episodes that were around one\u00a0hour each. Jared Leto portrayed Neumann in the series. \u201cInspired by actual events \u2013 and the love story at the center of it all. WeWork grew from a single coworking space into a global brand worth $47 billion in under a decade. Then, in less than a year, its valuation dropped $40 billion. What happened?\u201d a description for \u201cWeCrashed\u201d reads. The Reddit post shares\u00a0financial details like annual revenue and operating costs and goes\u00a0into detail regarding\u00a0an\u00a0investment in the company by Softbank (OTC:SFTBY). \u201cThe saga continues\u2026Or does it,\u201d the post reads. The post says that\u00a0WeWork needs to hit $1 in the next eight weeks to stay on the NYSE and could see institutional investors coming in to help the company\u2019s financial situation. Reddit users upvoted the post, which\u00a0saw hundreds of comments of investors who said\u00a0they were buying shares of WeWork. What\u2019s Next: With shares of WeWork trading under $1, the company will need to see shares pass this level to meet listing requirements or need to complete a reverse stock split to hit the pricing threshold. One of the big questions that could be answered soon will be if a short squeeze-style move could happen in WeWork shares.\u00a0 Recall that retail traders were inspired by a callout on the r/WallStreetBest subreddit of an investment opportunity in GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME). Part of the inspiration for investments in GameStop came from seeing that hedge funds were heavily shorting GameStop and betting on the failure of the video game company, which led to a massive short squeeze. Less than 3% of WeWork shares were short as of the latest data, but that could change when the next report is released and takes into account anyone that went short after the company shared concerns about its\u00a0future.\u00a0 Early 2021 saw the birth of the \u2018\"meme stock\" phenomenon on r/WallStreetBets. The community noticed that GameStop was heavily shorted by institutional hedge funds, so retail traders piled into the stock, triggering a massive short squeeze. An epic battle similar to David vesus\u00a0Goliath emerged and became one of the biggest stories of Wall Street in decades. Like the story of WeWork, the story of GameStop has been told through several documentary-style movies and television series. The story was also turned into a book by Ben Mezrich, which will hit the big screen later this year with the theatrical release of \u201cDumb Money\u201d in September 2023. WE Price Action: Shares of WeWork soared on Thursday, trading in a range of 15 cents to 32 cents. On Friday, WeWork shares traded between 19 cents and 28 cents. Thursday\u2019s intraday high was the highest shares had traded since May 17, 2023. WeWork shares closed at 20 cents Friday, up 11% on the day. Shares of the company have traded between $0.12 and $5.85 over the last 52-weeks and are down 96% in the last year.

                "title": "Apple Eyes 'Splashy Upgrade' For Tenth-anniversary Edition Watch After Minor Upgrade With Series 9: Blood Pressure Monitoring, MicroLED Display And More",
                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is readying a \"splashy upgrade\" for the tenth-anniversary edition of its smartwatch, said Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman. What Happened: Following a minor refresh of the 2023 models that are due in September, Apple is aiming to move away from the \"slow-but-steady\" annual upgrade cycle, said Gurman in his weekly Power On newsletter. \u201cApple isn't giving consumers many reasons to buy a new watch with each generation,\u201d the columnist said. After the 2022 launch of the Apple Watch Ultra, which included high-end upgrades, 2023 will once again be a low-key affair, he said. The Apple Watch Series 9 lineup will likely be launched alongside the iPhone 15 series at an event on Sept. 12, Gurman said. He expects it to have the same size as the current models but with faster processors and fresh colors. \u201cIn terms of new features, it's arguably the most minor upgrade in the product's history,\u201d he added. When launching new watches, Apple typically targets first-time smartwatch buyers, people with older models, and Samsung and Fitbit users, the columnist said. Because of this, Gurman said he expects the company to stick with the once-a-year upgrade cycle. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Radical Overhaul: Apple is planning a \u201cWatch X\u201d model to mark the device's 10-year anniversary, and it promises to be the biggest overhaul yet, Gurman said. Because the Apple Watch was first unveiled in 2014 and released the following year, Watch X could be released either in 2024 or 2025, he said. With the Watch X, Apple designers are working on a thinner watch case and are exploring the possibility of changing the way bands are attached to the device, Gurman said. The company is toying with the idea of a new magnetic band attachment system, as designers feel the current system takes up a considerable amount of space that could be better filled with a bigger battery or other components. Gurman additionally flagged other major changes, including a\u00a0microLED display\u00a0that tops the color and clarity of the current OLED screens, as well as a\u00a0technology for monitoring blood pressure. Apple closed Friday's session at $177.79, up 0.03%, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "An insider scoop shared by an anonymous X user going by the handle\u00a0@Unknownz21\u00a0revealed intriguing details about the upcoming iPhone SE, otherwise known as the\u00a0iPhone SE 4,\u00a0from\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). The newest\u00a0iteration is expected to break new ground by being the first to\u00a0incorporate\u00a0Face ID. Consequently, this signifies the departure of the familiar Touch ID feature from the front of all iPhones. More about the SE 4 - planned features and design changes:\r\n- Design based on iPhone 14\r\n- Face ID\r\n- USB-C\r\n- Action button\r\n- Only one rear camera Interestingly, the leaked information implies that the iPhone SE 4 will diverge from its predecessors in a significant way. Regarding hardware modifications, the forthcoming iPhone SE 4 is set to embrace USB-C technology, replacing the conventional Lightning port. See Also:\u00a0Back To School: Grab The iPad Mini 2021 In A Steal Deal At $399 Additionally, it will introduce the long-anticipated Action Button, which is expected to replace the\u00a0mute switch. This new feature will make its debut on the\u00a0iPhone 15 Pro. The device will also have\u00a0just one\u00a0rear camera. Rather than drawing inspiration from older chassis models, the phone is\u00a0rumored to\u00a0use\u00a0design elements from the iPhone 14, a notably recent addition to Apple's lineup. This could be Apple's debut attempt at adapting the design of a previous iPhone iteration to create an SE model. The switch to USB-C aligns with the regulations set forth by the European Union. The\u00a0departure from Apple's traditional approach has raised\u00a0eyebrows, particularly since\u00a0the brand has historically excelled in enhancing classic designs with cutting-edge processors while keeping affordability in mind. The concept of diminishing the capabilities of a prior phone model represents a distinctive departure from the norm.

She also questioned whether it could be attributed to extensive iPhone usage, having already reached 450 charge cycles, or the rapid charging process and heat generation.\u00a0 YouTuber and tech expert\u00a0Aaron Zollo\u00a0also took to\u00a0X, formerly known as\u00a0Twitter, saying battery health problems in iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max appear to be linked to glitchy software that demands more frequent charging.\u00a0 He revealed that during iOS 17 beta phase, he needed to charge his device twice daily.\u00a0 iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max battery health issues seem to be relegated to buggy software in my opinion requiring more charge.  With iOS 17 betas I am charging twice a day.  Yes it's a beta, but we didn't have this issue previously years.

The measure was implemented in response to the \u201cbatterygate\u201d scandal, which resulted in significant settlements for the company,\u00a0reported\u00a0The Verge.\u00a0 Apple did not immediately respond to\u00a0Benzinga\u2019s\u00a0request for comments.\u00a0 Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0Typically, iPhones maintain their battery capacities for around two years, making this early decline a cause for unease among users. Apple\u2019s official guideline states that iPhone batteries should retain up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 complete charge cycles.\u00a0 Replacing the battery in an iPhone 14 series model after the one-year warranty will cost users $99.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the upcoming iPhone 15 series is expected to come with larger battery sizes. The increase, purportedly ranging from 10% to 18%, aims to offer users a more sustainable and reliable battery performance.

                "body": "Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 launch is just a few weeks away, and in the run-up to the launch, a new leak suggests that the iPhone 15 Pro models could get the highly anticipated 8GB RAM upgrade with a performance bump. What Happened: A new leak has increased hopes of Apple upgrading the memory in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models to 8GB after keeping it unchanged at 6GB for three years. See Also: iPhone 15 Launch Likely On September 12: Thinner Bezels To Periscope Camera And Action Button, Everything We Know So Far According to a new tip by leaker @URedditor on X (formerly Twitter), Apple has been testing the iPhone 15 Pro models with the new A17 Bionic chipset with 6GB and 8GB of RAM. In addition, the source states that Apple has been testing the faster LPDDR5 version of RAM for the iPhone 15 series, which offers up to 50% faster data transfer speeds and up to 30% more efficient operation when compared to its predecessor. Previous reports had suggested that Apple could keep the memory unchanged at 6GB, despite the last increase being way back in 2020 with the iPhone 12 Pro. However, Apple seems to be aware of the need for more memory and has been testing the 8GB RAM configuration as well. There Is A Catch, Though: That said, the source is still determining whether Apple will offer 6GB or 8GB RAM in the iPhone 15 Pro models. There is a possibility that Apple could offer the 8GB option with higher storage models \u2013 just like a lot of Android smartphone makers do. However, it is still speculation at this point, so we will have to keep our eyes peeled for a more concrete answer in this regard.

                "body": "Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) next-gen A17 Bionic chipset is expected to power the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. While Apple's silicon has usually been notably more powerful than Qualcomm Inc.'s (NASDAQ:QCOM), the gap between the two seems to be widening. What Happened: The Apple A17 Bionic chipset has reportedly popped up on benchmarking platform Geekbench, delivering a 47% better performance than Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which is expected to launch later this year, according to a tip by @NaveenTechWala. See Also: Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro Models Could Still Get 8GB RAM With A Performance Bump, But There\u2019s A Catch The Geekbench score shows the A17 Bionic with a single-thread score of 3,269 points, while the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 has recorded a score of 2,223 points. This is a 47% gap between their performance. Why Is It Important: Both the A17 Bionic and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipsets are the next-generation flagships of Apple and Qualcomm, respectively. While the A17 Bionic is expected to power the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is expected to power top-tier Android flagship phones like the Samsung Galaxy S24 series. The A17 Bionic chipset's domination might not be all that surprising, but beating an upcoming flagship chipset from the closest rival by a 47% margin is what makes it jaw-dropping. That's not where it ends, either \u2013 the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset's performance is also worse than last year's A16 Bionic chipset, which has recorded a single-thread score of 2,513 points. Essentially, the fastest Android phone of late 2023 or early 2024 could end up being slower than 2022's iPhone 14.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could be headed for a weak holiday season \u2013 its top supplier Foxconn Technology Co. Ltd.'s (OTCPK: FXCOF) parent company Hon Hai has predicted an overall decline in iPhone shipments in 2023. What Happened: Foxconn parent Hon Hai now expects the overall iPhone demand in 2023 to decline as the global smartphone industry witnesses a slowdown. See Also: Weak iPhone Demand Could Lead To Apple\u2019s Largest Q3 Revenue Drop Since 2016 In its June quarter earnings, Hon Hai estimated that its overall sales would decline in 2023 after it initially forecast flat revenue. An expected contraction drives the worsening outlook in most of its core businesses, including smartphone manufacturing. \"iPhone shipments from Foxconn in the fourth quarter and next year's first quarter will be lower than they were a year earlier, due to weak demand from multiple key markets such as the US, China and Japan,\" said Counterpoint Research analyst Ivan Lam, as quoted by Bloomberg. Why Is It Important: Apple has not been insulated from a decline in smartphone demand \u2013 the iPhone maker is expected to see a 2% decline in iPhone revenue in September. This would make it the largest revenue fall in the September quarter since 2016. Most of the decline in Apple\u2019s topline in the September quarter is expected to come from the Americas. On its part, Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture 85 million units of the iPhone 15 series this year, keeping its demand steady from the iPhone 14 series last year. Even if there is a demand slowdown, Apple might offset some of this impact thanks to an expected $100 increase in iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max prices.

                "body": "Ugly week last week, creating a weekly bearish imbalance and closing below previous support. Price did hold the weekly bullish order block, which to me means one of two things... 1 being bulls need to step up this week to reclaim the previously lost support or more downside is to come, or 2 being even if bulls do not step up, I'm not really seeing the potential for a large, swift move down, as there are two previous bullish order blocks in this area that make take some time to work through. Not the biggest data week ahead, but there are a few that can move price.   Like ES, NQ had an ugly week as well. The one difference here is that while ES created a bearish Imbalance in the process, NQ did not. NQ is in dangerous territory though, Approaching weekly swing low at 14853, which would shift weekly market structure bearish in my book for the first time in a long time.  Despite last week's bearish PA, the ES daily doesn't look too bad for bulls. Price got into the lowest discount bullish imbalance and bounced, closing back inside the imbalance from early July and between the 62% and 79% retracement. ES bulls do not want to lose the bullish levels below 4450.  NQ daily saved itself for now, closing above recent swing low at 15080. Took liquidity and bounced to close Friday. I am very neutral at the moment, knowing that the bulls have a chance to save themselves this week, but could also lose some really important support levels to the bears.  DXY remains strong and fills the daily bearish imbalance just above the 79% retracement level. Could this be the week for DXY to head for the swing high at 103.57, driving the price of indices lower, or will price reject here for a drive lower for a bounce on indices?  SPY (NYSE:SPY) 30 min shifted market structure to bullish on Friday, taking out the swing high from Thursday, retracing and holding the discount bullish imbalance and closing in resistance. Upside levels at 446.70, 447.48 and 447.95. A shift back bearish would occur on a break of swing low liquidity at 443.35.  AAPL (NASDAQ:AAPL) took out swing low from 8/9 and found support at 176.55 before bouncing on Friday. Met resistance above 178.50 again, and consolidated into close. Bulls want to see a move above that resistance level, which could lead to a test of the 179.50 level getting a test.  Like AAPL, TSLA\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) took out a swing low and found support at 238.19 before bouncing to close out the day. UNLIKE AAPL, TSLA did not take out any recent swing highs, leaving market structure bearish. Heavy put flow came in on Friday as well.  GOOGL (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rejected Friday's opening gap and dropped 1.5 points, before finding support at 128.50. Market structure remains bearish for me until one of those swing highs are taken out.  AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) a beautiful short last week. Retracement into the 79% level and dumped, taking out the swing low at 107.38, a 12 point move. Next area of downside liquidity is 105.15.  PLTR (NYSE:PLTR) has been consolidating following the 8/9 dump. Currently pinned between two levels of liquidity at 15.87 and 14.92.  Like PLTR, AMZN (NASDAQ:AMZN) is currently pinned between two levels of liquidity at 140.40 and 137.15. Until then, not much cooking here for me.

                "body": "On Friday, Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies reported modest growth of its consumer business amid U.S. sanctions and slower than expected recovery of the country\u2019s economy.\u00a0 During the second quarter, overall revenue rose 4.8% YoY to\u00a0178.8 billion yuan. But when looking at the bigger picture during the first half of the year, consumer business revenue grew only\u00a02.2% YoY to 103.5 billion yuan\u00a0which equated to $14.27 billion, which is twice as less compared to 2019 and 2020's comparable period.\u00a0This is the only segment with YoY comparisons as Huawei started breaking down sales by segments late last year. However, overall revenue rose 3.1% to 310.9 billion yuan. The biggest revenue contributor was the ICT infrastructure business, which includes revenue from carrier and enterprise services, with sales amounting to 167.2 billion yuan. Cloud services brought in revenue of 24.1 billion yuan.\u00a0Net profit margin rose 5% YoY to 15% over the first half of the year.\u00a0 Intelligent automotive solutions, a segment that covers tech for new energy vehicles brought in revenue of 1 billion yuan over the first half of the year. As for the company\u2019s EV brand, Aito, whose sales are included in the consumer business, reportedly made 100,000 EVs during the last 15 months.\u00a0 In July, Huawei launched an AI model that enhances safety and improves the efficiency of mining operations. Despite U.S. sanctions that restricted its access to advanced process technologies, Huawei is determined to establish a strong presence in the AI-powered universe. At its Huawei Developer Conference in July, it unveiled its AI model that can be used for\u00a0a wide range of industrial and scientific applications.\u00a0 Huawei expects\u00a0its\u00a0flagship consumer products to return to\u00a0normalcy this year despite\u00a0a\u00a0struggling smartphone market that reached maturity, with even Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) suffering the consequences. Although Apple succeeded to beat estimates with its latest report, even the mighty Apple reported its sales fell for the third consecutive quarter. Apple got saved by\u00a0all-time revenue record in\u00a0services\u00a0but it slightly missed iPhone sales estimates.\u00a0Back in July, even Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) guiding for sales below estimates due to a slumping smartphone market. As Qualcomm reported that it does not have the license to sell 5G chips to companies, it warned of lower-than-expected sales for the undergoing quarter with consumer spending on smartphones and similar gadgets remaining weak amid a gloomy macroeconomic perspective. As Qualcomm only has a license to sell 4G chips to Huawei, it did not assume any material revenue going forward. Qualcomm also tried to diversify its business beyond smartphone chips and went into producing computer chips for the automotive sector.\u00a0 Huawei reported that back in 2022, revenue barely grew and in 2021, it recorded its first revenue decline. Huawei got blacklisted by the Trump administration in 2019,\u00a0as\u00a0American companies\u00a0got restricted to sell\u00a0to the Chinese telecommunications giant, including\u00a0licensed access to the latest versions of\u00a0Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)-owned\u00a0Google\u2019s Android operating system.\u00a0In response, Huawei released\u00a0Harmony OS,\u00a0its own system. Earlier this month, it unveiled the latest version that was reportedly\u00a0downloaded over one million times in three days. Huawei remains confident of meeting its annual targets and its relevancy in today\u2019s business world. DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is showing an overnight gap up, aiming to reclaim our pivotal 446.31 mark. If it sustains above this today, bulls might set their sights on 447.94. With sustained buying momentum, we anticipate a surge to the day's bullish peak of 449.42. Conversely, if 446.31 faces a downturn, a bearish move towards 445.08 is anticipated. A further decline could see 443.90 and then 443.42. In the event of intense selling, our bearish floor is 442.61. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) have shown an overnight gap up and hover just above our 366.69 benchmark. If this level remains resilient, bulls might target 367.52, with potential ascents to 368.57. The day's bullish peak is set at 369.39. However, if the 369.69 mark falters, a bearish descent to 366.15 is anticipated. A further decline could see 365.59, with a bearish extreme at 364.65. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is trading within our 177.31 to 178.61 channel. We anticipate a breakout from this range this week. On the upside, bulls could target 179.36, with an optimistic ceiling at 180.60. A breach below 177.31 could see bears eyeing 176.29, with a potential floor at 175.09. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0has shown an overnight gap up but hasn't sustained our 323.17 support. Bulls would aim to recover this, potentially targeting the day's bullish zenith of 326.05. If 323.17 remains elusive, bears might push towards 321.51, with a pessimistic base at 320.05. Google\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) trades beneath our 130.41 marker. If this persists, bears might target our support at 128.91. With strong selling momentum, the bearish nadir could be 127.71. A recovery above 130.41 could see a bullish move to our high bull target of 131.28. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) trades below our 301.71 threshold. Bulls would aim to surpass this, with a potential surge to the day's bullish peak of 304.77. Failing to surpass 301.71 could see a bearish move to 300.23. If this crucial support at 300.23 is breached with significant selling, our bearish floor is set at 297.33. NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading below our 409.31 benchmark. If this persists, bears might target 405.18, with a bearish nadir at 402.12. A recovery above 409.31 could see a bullish move to the higher target of 413.76. Final Word: Today's trading session is likely to be subdued, given the lack of scheduled data releases. This might result in a quieter session with reduced volume. Stay cautious and trade wisely.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is negative.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "body": "Samsung's next-generation flagship, the Galaxy S24 series, could feature an advanced satellite connectivity feature only available on Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones. What Happened: Samsung's Galaxy S24 series could feature the life-saving satellite connectivity feature missing from almost all Android phones. See Also: Apple\u2019s 2023 Holiday Season Looks Cloudy: Key Supplier Predicts A Decline In iPhone Demand Only rival Apple has the satellite connectivity feature built into iPhones. South Korea's Minister of Science and ICT, Lee Jong-ho, said in an interview with Yonhap News that the country's smartphone companies are working on adding a feature that would allow their phones to communicate with satellites. Given that the only major smartphone maker in South Korea now is Samsung after LG shut down its smartphone business, Jong-ho is believed to be referring to Samsung. \u201cI cannot say for sure, but I know that the domestic industry is considering commercializing the service next year, expecting that a standard related to satellite communication will be prepared next year,\" Jong-ho said. Post the Galaxy S23 series launch this year, TM Roh, head of Samsung's mobile division, said that the company would bring satellite connectivity \"when there is the right timing, infrastructure, and technology\". Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset powering the Galaxy S23 series supports satellite connectivity. However, Samsung decided against shipping the feature. Why Satellite Connectivity Is Important: Apple is the only other major company to offer satellite connectivity, which has already saved several lives. Most recently, Apple's Emergency SOS feature saved multiple lives during the wildfires in Maui. Even without cellular connectivity, iPhones used satellite connectivity to send out an SOS to rescuers along with accurate coordinates, allowing responders to rescue people. Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S24 series in the first quarter of 2024. It could use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset or its own Exynos 2400 chipset \u2013 while Qualcomm already has satellite connectivity in its feature set, Samsung too has the technology ready to deploy.

                "title": "Time To Sell Technology In Favor Of New Leadership? Charting The Great Rotation Of 2023",
                "body": "Every week that goes by seems to show how the mega cap stocks that pushed the market higher in the first seven months of the year have now taken a back seat.\u00a0Sectors like Financials and Energy have seen improved relative strength, while previous bellwether groups like semiconductors have begun to underperform. When I noted bearish momentum divergences on key growth names last month, I began to think through a scenario called \u201cThe Great Rotation of 2023\u201d.\u00a0The general line of thinking was that if and when growth stocks decided to take a breather, those assets would rotate elsewhere.\u00a0 Would it be to cyclical sectors like Energy, or more defensive sectors like Utilities? As the Nasdaq 100 closed below its 50-day moving average this week, following similar breaks of support from stocks like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), it seems that market has answered in a clear voice that it\u2019s sectors like Energy which are now taking a new leadership role in August 2023. Let\u2019s review the technical setup that led to this great rotation, how to visualize the leadership roles shifting between sectors, and identify some ETFs that may have further opportunities to outperform in the coming weeks and months. Stocks like Microsoft and Apple made consistently higher highs pretty much every month in 2023. But after making new highs in mid-July, both stocks have now pushed lower and now have violated the 50-day moving average.  AAPL has demonstrated perhaps the clearest evidence of a stock in a distribution phase, with a gap below the 50-day moving average followed immediately by further downside movement.\u00a0This suggests that no willing buyers came in to buy on price weakness, but instead that more selling pressure is in play. The Nasdaq 100 is now about 6% off its July high, while leading names like AAPL and MSFT are down 11% and 13%, respectively.\u00a0I was taught that \u201call large losses begin as small losses,\u201d and given the initial downthrust in these leading names, I\u2019m inclined to stay out of the way until some sort of support level is established. With the top-heavy nature of our equity indexes, with even the S&P 500 weighted heavily to these mega cap growth stocks, the S&P is also under pressure.  The SPX did manage to hold its 50-day moving average this week, but it\u2019s worth noting that only 55% of S&P 500 members are above their own 50-day moving average.\u00a0That\u2019s down from about 90% just three weeks ago!\u00a0 To rephrase, about a third of the S&P 500 members have broken their 50-day moving average in the last couple weeks.\u00a0 The weekly RRG chart provides an ideal way to visualize sector rotation, so a review of the RRG seemed to be a logical next step for me to quantify a potential rotation from growth to value. Back in March, the RRG was very much in a growth-over-value position.\u00a0Growth sectors like Technology and Communication Services were firmly in the Leading Quadrant, and value-oriented sectors like Financials and Energy were pushing into the Lagging Quadrant.  Growth sectors dominated the first six months of 2023, and even into June you could still see the strong outperformance of the FAANG sectors.\u00a0But all of a sudden, forgotten sectors like Financials and Energy started to improve.\u00a0Relative strength readings began to stabilize as most sectors saw improving price action. Now in August, the drop in growth stocks has created a very different appearance to the RRG chart.\u00a0  Note how the XLC and XLK are now in the Weakening Quadrant, showing a decline in relative strength momentum after the recent pullback.\u00a0 The Improving Quadrant includes sectors like Industrials, Financials, Energy, and Materials, all of which have seen a definitive improvement in relative strength. The Great Rotation of 2023 appears to be less about a rotation from offense to defense, and more about a rotation from growth sectors to cyclical sectors like Energy.\u00a0 So which ETFs have improved to the point where they deserve a second look for investors? I often scan for stocks and ETFs making new swing highs for my Market Misbehavior Premium Members.\u00a0The S&P SPDR Oil & Gas Exploration and Production ETF (NYSE:XOP)\u00a0surfaced recently as an example of a previously underperforming industry group that has rotated higher.  The second panel down shows the relative strength of the XOP as well as the Oil Services ETF (NYSE:OIH) relative to the S&P 500. Note the downtrend in relative strength through the end of April, the sideways relative performance in June and early July, and then to period of outperformance from mid-July through mid-August. Now check out the bottom panel to see how two technology ETFs- IYW and SMH- have performed during this same period.\u00a0Just as the RRG showed a clear rotation away from growth and into value, this chart shows the Great Rotation from sectors like Technology to new leadership including Energy. We can speculate about when and how this Great Rotation will end, and when growth sectors will once again step into a leadership role.\u00a0I\u2019d much rather wait patiently for the charts to indicate that conditions have changed once again.\u00a0For now, the charts are telling me to focus on emerging leadership in cyclical sectors until proven otherwise!

                "body": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway introduced new stakes in D.R. Horton Inc, NVR Inc, and Lennar Corp last quarter according to a recent 13F filing Did you notice the surge in some homebuilder stocks on Monday during the aftermarket session? The reason behind this jump is Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B). Let\u2019s delve into the details. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a favorite of Warren Buffett, continues to be Berkshire\u2019s largest holding, valued at just over $177.5 billion, according to Berkshire\u2019s latest 13F filing. Last quarter, Berkshire introduced new stakes in D.R. Horton Inc (NYSE:DHI), NVR Inc (NYSE:NVR), and Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN), With whispers of rising mortgage rates and potential repercussions, Berkshire\u2019s decision to further invest in the U.S. housing market could signal that the market has reached its bottom. It's not Berkshire's first dance with the housing market, either. Remember the acquisition of Clayton Homes two decades ago for $1.7 billion and its ongoing ownership of Benjamin Moore? Buffett's Berkshire picked up nearly 6 million shares of DHI, 11,000 shares of NVR, and nearly 153,000 shares of Lennar.\n\nRead also: Coatue Management Bullish On AI, Electric Vehicles In Q2 While Cautious On Chinese Equities Investors should keep an eye on homebuilding ETFs like the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE:XHB), and iShares US Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB) in the coming weeks. While the emphasis is on homebuilders, there\u2019s also been a reshuffling of other equities. Berkshire upped the ante in Capital One Financial Corp (NYSE:COF) by 25% and gave a nod to Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) with a 5% increase. However, it wasn\u2019t all additions; Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Globe Life Inc (NYSE:GL) saw stakes reduced by 70% and 60%, respectively. And, Berkshire completely exited its positions in Vitesse Energy Inc (NYSE:VTS), McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), and Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC) this quarter.\n\nRead next: \u2018The Big Short\u2019 Investor Is Going Big Short: Burry\u2019s 13F Says The Bull Run Of 2023 Is Over With 40,000 Puts On The SPY, QQQ Photo: Shutterstock and Fortune Live Media\u00a0on Flickr",

A new leak has shown off the first images and specifications of the Samsung XR headset prototype. What Happened: Samsung is reportedly working on its own extended reality (XR) headset to compete with the Apple Vision Pro headset, with the first images of the prototype now out, courtesy of Chinese news portal Vrtuoluo. See Also: Samsung Galaxy S24 Could Borrow This Life Saving Feature From The iPhone The leaked images show the Samsung XR headset with four motion tracking cameras, two RGB infrared cameras positioned similarly to the real position of human eyes, and a depth sensor to take care of hand and environment tracking. Samsung has also reportedly included microdisplays and pancake lenses to ensure the visor is thin enough. Samsung's own Exynos 2200 chipset powering the headset instead of the Qualcomm XR chipset. It's an interesting choice, given that the Exynos 2200 chipset has been panned for overheating quickly and high power consumption. On the pricing front, the Samsung XR headset could be priced in the $1,000 to $2,000 range. Although the range is quite wide, it is considerably cheaper than the $3,500 Apple Vision Pro headset. The Samsung XR headset is expected to launch in 2024, and Android will power it. Not Samsung's First Rodeo: Samsung is no stranger to virtual reality headsets. It launched its first device, the Samsung Gear VR, back in 2015 in partnership with Oculus VR. It announced a successor in 2017 at just $130, which is about 27 times cheaper than the Apple Vision Pro headset. With that said, the XR capabilities have since expanded, and the technology has advanced. However, it remains to be seen if Samsung XR significantly undercut the Apple Vision Pro in terms of pricing.

See Also: iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14: 6 Changes That Will Make The iPhone 15 A Notable Upgrade DSCC is a display market research firm, and according to OLED panel shipments, the revenue share of iPhones in the top five has fallen from 51.2% at the end of the March quarter to 46.3%. iPhone 15 Effect: Some of this slowdown could be attributed to the upcoming iPhone 15 series launch expected in September. For instance, demand for the more premium iPhone 14 Pro models has fallen off a cliff. While the iPhone 14 Pro Max's revenue share fell from 20.1% in the March quarter to 10.7% in the June quarter, the iPhone 14 Pro's share fell from 15.6% to 9.2%. On the other hand, the iPhone 14's share almost doubled from 7.7% to 15.3%. Likewise, iPhone 13's share rose from 7.8% to 11.1%. Four out of the top five performers were all iPhones. Samsung's Galaxy S23 Ultra was the only non-iPhone model, coming in fifth place with a share of 5.2%.

Once done, an emergency slider will appear on the screen \u2013 simply drag it to make the call. Your iPhone will also send your location to your emergency contacts via text.

For example, the crash detection feature was falsely triggered in instances when users were playing sports like skiing, snowboarding, and more. In such cases, you might want to turn off Emergency SOS. While there is no single toggle to turn off Emergency SOS on iPhone, you can turn it off by disabling all the options by following these steps: Despite this, the Emergency SOS feature can still be accessed from the power-off screen. However, since this is done manually, you don't have to worry about it being triggered falsely. It is worth repeating that Emergency SOS is a life-saving feature, so disable it with extreme prejudice and consider enabling it again once you are done with the activity that could falsely trigger it.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) has experienced an overnight gap down and is striving to recover above our pivotal level of 445.08. If trading remains resilient above this mark, bullish momentum could drive the price towards our next target of 446.31. With sustained buying pressure, we could see a surge towards our top bullish target for the day at 447.94. Conversely, if 445.08 isn't secured by bullish forces, significant selling pressure could push us towards 443.90. Our ultimate bearish target stands at 443.42. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) have seen an overnight gap down and are hovering just below our pivotal level of 368.57. If bullish momentum can sustain above this level, we anticipate a move towards 369.39. With continued buying, 370.08 might be in sight, with the day's top bullish target at 370.91. If trading struggles to maintain above 368.57, bearish forces might drive the price to 367.52. If this level proves fragile, a further decline to 366.69 could occur. In the event of significant selling, our bearish target for the day is 366.15. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is currently trading slightly above our pivotal level of 178.61. On the upside, we're eyeing 179.36 as the next target for bullish traders. The day's top bullish target for Apple stands at 180.60. On the downside, if 178.61 support falters, bearish momentum could push the price to 177.31. In the case of a significant decline, our bearish target is 176.29. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) \u00a0is hovering around our crucial support level of 321.51. Bullish traders would want the price to remain above this mark, aiming for a rally towards 323.17. With strong buying, we could see a move towards the day's top bullish target of 326.05. If 321.51 fails to hold, bearish momentum might drive the price to 320.05. In the event of intense selling, our bearish target for the day stands at 318.48. Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is trading slightly above our pivotal level of 130.41. If this support remains intact, bullish momentum could target 131.28, with the day's top target at 131.76. Conversely, if 130.41 doesn't hold, bearish forces might push the price to 129.52. The day's ultimate bearish target for Alphabet is 128.91. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) is trading around our pivotal level of 304.77. Bullish traders would aim to maintain this as support, targeting an upward move to 308.16. The day's top bullish target for Meta stands at 309.51. If 304.77 fails to hold, bearish momentum might drive the price to 301.71. A significant decline could test the 300.23 level. In the event of intense selling, our bearish target for the day is 297.33. Following a strong session dominated by buyers, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is in focus after Morgan Stanley's 'top pick' recommendation. If this bullish sentiment persists, we're looking for 447.05 to serve as support. A strong trading day could see the price targeting 450.04, with the potential to reach our top bullish target of 454.09. If 447.05 fails to hold, bearish forces might drive the price to 442.76. Intense selling could test our support at 439.87, with the day's ultimate bearish target at 436.56.

                "body": "Many changes have been made to social media platform Twitter since Elon Musk acquired the company for $44 billion in 2022. Recently, Twitter, now rebranded as X, has been offloading various items from its main office. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s up for sale and how you can snag a piece of Twitter history. What Happened:\u00a0Musk's choice to rename Twitter as X garnered varied responses from analysts, investors, and the platform's users.\u00a0The decision could also come with lawsuits as it was revealed that several other companies have trademarks related to the name. Benzinga reported on a previous auction held by Twitter in January where various items from its headquarters were sold. Reports also suggested that Musk was trying to sell more items from Twitter, including the company\u2019s plants. Twitter has another round of items going up for auction. The auction will be led by Heritage Global Partners, a unit of Heritage Global (NASDAQ:HGBL). Heritage has titled the auction \u201cTwitter Rebranding: Online Auction Featuring Memorabilia, Art, Office Assets & More!\u201d on its website. Auction bidding will run from Sept. 12 at 10 a.m. ET through Sept. 14 at 12 p.m. ET. There are 678 lots listed on the auction website, with starting bids of $25 for each item. Related Link: Elon Musk's Reasons For Buying Twitter: 'I Didn't Do It To Make Money, I Did It To Try To Help Humanity'\u00a0 Here\u2019s a look at the highlights. Twitter Auction Highlights: The 678 items up for sale in the latest Twitter auction range from furniture to Twitter blue bird logos. Numerous auctions include chairs, sofas, stools, desks, lockers, video conferencing systems and work stations. Among the other highlights include: Twitter Essentials 24 Records And Record Player: This lot includes 24 iconic records like Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller,\u201d Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On,\u201d Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cDark Side of the Moon,\u201d Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cRumors\u201d and more and also comes with a record player. These were at one point the 24 iconic\u00a0records that were regularly played at the Twitter headquarters building. Musical Instruments: The auctions also include several acoustic guitars and a Pearl drum set. While none of the instruments are likely rare, they come with the added piece of history that they belonged to Twitter Twitter Hashtag Signs: One of the most well-known phrases linked to Twitter remains the hashtag, which focuses on topics and trending items. Several hashtag-themed signs like a light-up version of the hashtag are up for auction Robin Williams art tribute: One item likely to catch the eyes of bidders is a piece of art that pays tribute to actor Robin Williams. The artwork features tweets shared by others that pay tribute to Williams. Williams appears as his likeness from the movie \u201cGood Morning Vietnam\u201d on the artwork, and his tweet \u201cNo matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world\u201d is featured at the center\u00a0of the messages. Twitter Blue Bird Logos: Several of the iconic blue bird Twitter logos that are on the sides of the headquarters are up for auction. Bidders should note that the winners of the auction have to hire a licensed company with permits to remove the signs. There are two blue bird logos up for auction that are still mounted to the company\u2019s headquarters, with one located on 10th Street and another located on Jessie Street. Twitter Blue Bird Lobby Sign: For those who can\u2019t secure the company and permits needed to take down the blue bird logos on the side of Twitter headquarters, there is also a blue bird logo sign up for sale from the company\u2019s lobby. The item is made with translucent plexiglass. Ellen DeGeneres Iconic Tweet Artwork: At one time, a tweet made by Ellen DeGeneres at the 2014 Academy Awards was the most shared post on Twitter. The selfie included many celebrities from the movie awards show including Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Kevin Spacey. Artwork by Debbie Faas recreates the iconic moment. Obama Artwork: Another piece of artwork up for auction is a painting by Faas titled \u201cFour More Years.\u201d The artwork depicts Barack Obama and Michelle Obama hugging to celebrate his victory in the 2012 election. Apple Computers: Among the 678 lots are many computers and office-related supplies. There are a total of 97 Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) computers and items up for auction, such as Apple Thunderbolt 27\u201d display monitors, and many include standing desks as well. With starting bids of $25, the Apple products could see early interest.\u00a0 Read Next: Elon Musk Now The Most Followed Person On Twitter\u00a0 Photo: Shutterstock",

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "title": "Apple Stock Consolidates Plunge Dragging S&P 500 Lower: The Bull, Bear Case",
                "body": "Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was dropping about 0.7% on Tuesday, continuing to fall slightly lower within a downtrend pattern after breaking bearishly from a rising channel pattern on Aug. 3. The Cupertino, California-based company was reacting negatively to stronger-than-expected retail sales data for July, which was released by the U.S. Census Bureau, pulling the market lower due to how heavily weighted Apple is in the S&P 500. A downtrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of lower lows and lower highs on the chart. The lower lows indicate the bears are in control while the intermittent lower highs indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify a downtrend with descending lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term downtrend. Descending longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicate a long-term downtrend. If Apple\u2019s downtrend continues, volatility in the stock market is likely to continue rising. Traders looking for continuation in elevated volatility in the stock market can use MIAX\u2019s SPIKES Volatility products. The products, which are traded on SPIKES Volatility Index (XMIO: SPIKE), track expected volatility in the SPDR S&P 500 over the next 30 days.

                "body": "Mizuho\u00a0analyst\u00a0Dan Dolev\u00a0reiterated a Buy on\u00a0PayPal Holdings, Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:PYPL) with a\u00a0price target of $92.00. The analyst expressed surprise at the recent CEO appointment. The company named\u00a0Intuit Inc's\u00a0(NASDAQ:INTU) Alex Chriss as CEO,\u00a0effective September 27, 2023. Chriss will be inheriting a challenged but not unfixable story. First and foremost, PayPal will need to change the\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0AAPL) Apple Pay share loss narrative, which he considers the #1 drag on the stock.\u00a0 Chriss must also decide on the possibility of combining the PayPal and Venmo brands.\u00a0 Dolev expects a modest positive stock reaction, mainly on improved clarity regarding management change. The price target reflects a discount to\u00a0Visa Inc\u00a0(NYSE:\u00a0V) &\u00a0Mastercard Inc\u00a0(NYSE:\u00a0MA). KBW\u00a0analyst\u00a0Sanjay Sakhrani\u00a0had an Outperform rating with a price target of $90.00. The CEO update adds clarity following news of Dan Schulman's intention to retire earlier this year in February. Chriss is not among the name brands viewed as top candidates for the role by the investment community.\u00a0 While his experience in technology and product leadership and with a software platform within the SMB vertical make him suitable for the position, the market will likely perceive this as continued uncertainty regarding the impact he can have on PYPL.\u00a0 Since he is not an industry insider, Sakhrani thinks it may take some time to assess what the right go-forward strategy would be to reinvigorate growth.\u00a0 The question remains regarding what that means for investment spend and fundamentals in the near to medium term.\u00a0 Price Action:\u00a0PYPL shares traded lower by 4.79% at $60.24 on the last check Tuesday.",

                "body": "One of the most successful value investors of all-time shocked investors with the purchase of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares in 2016. The stock now makes up a large portion of the Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B) portfolio. Here\u2019s a look at how shares of the technology giant have performed since the \u201cOracle of Omaha\u2019s\u201d purchase was disclosed. What Happened: Legendary investor Warren Buffett unveiled a purchase of 9.8 million Apple shares on May 16, 2016. The shares were purchased by Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate led by Buffett. The Apple shares were bought at an average price of $27.25 at the time, adjusted for a 2020 stock split. The initial stake purchased by Buffett was around $1.1 billion. Buffett trimmed part of the Apple stock position in 2021, taking some gains from the investment in the technology giant. Since that time, Buffett has added to the Apple position, making it one of the biggest pieces in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio and making the company one of the biggest owners of Apple shares. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway added to its Apple stake, buying over 333,000 shares. In the first quarter of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway increased its holdings of Apple, adding 20,424,207 shares. At the end of the second quarter, Berkshire Hathaway owned 915,560,382 Apple shares. This stake constitutes approximately 50% of the firm's investment portfolio. Along with being a large holding of Buffett's investment portfolio, the large weighting of Apple shares also pays out a substantial amount in dividends to Berkshire Hathaway annually.\u00a0 Related Link: If You Invested $1,000 In Berkshire Hathaway When Warren Bufftett Did, Here's How Much You'd Have Now\u00a0 Investing $1,000 With Buffett: An investor who chose on May 16, 2016, the Berkshire Hathaway filing date, to buy a stake in Apple has done quite well. Shares of Apple traded at a split-adjusted level between $22.91 and $23.60 on May 16, 2016. An investment of $1,000 at the day\u2019s high could have bought 42.35 shares of Apple. Those 42.35 shares of Apple would be valued at $7,531.52 at the time of writing, based on a share price of $177.84 for AAPL. This represents a hypothetical return of 653.2% over the last seven years, one that has outperformed the overall stock market. Over the same duration, a $1,000 investment in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, mirroring the S&P 500, would have grown to $2,140.61. This equates to a theoretical return of 114.1%. Buffett is renowned for his value investing approach. His stake in Apple might be viewed by some as an unusual move, considering his inclination towards value rather than growth and his usual caution towards tech stocks. Investors who followed his investment are likely thankful they did. Read Next: A Highlight For Each Decade Of Warren Buffett's Life Photo: Unpslash and\u00a0Fortune Live Media\u00a0on Flickr",

What Happened:\u00a0The manufacturing of the latest edition of the iPhone is taking place at a Foxconn plant in Sriperumbudur, the Times of India reported. The latest move aligns with Apple\u2019s ongoing efforts to diversify its manufacturing away from China, as it looks to mitigate supply chain risks.

What Happened: Apple's latest iOS 17 developer beta 6 is rolling back a significant change in the call screen design \u2013 the position of the \"End Call\" button has been changed from the lower right corner to the center. See Also: iPhone 15 Effect? Data Suggests Demand For Older iPhones Has Slowed Down Ahead Of Apple\u2019s September Event Earlier last week, Apple moved the \"End Call\" button to the bottom right position, challenging the muscle memory of iPhone users. This button is in the bottom center position in iOS 16, but all the other buttons are in the middle part of the display. Within a week, however, Apple has brought the \"End Call\" button back to its center position. Other buttons like Audio, FaceTime, Mute, Add, and Keypad surround the End Call button. While this might seem like Apple is undecided about the \"End Call\" button's position, it suggests that the company wants to retain familiarity for iPhone users who are used to the button being in this position. However, they will still have to get used to the five other buttons surrounding it now. It's worth noting that given that this is a developer beta, the user interface design is not final yet. Apple could make a few more changes or retain the existing design, but this will become certain once the iOS 17 update rolls out to the public. iOS 17 Developer Beta 6 Changes: With the final release of iOS 17 just a few weeks away, Apple is now refining the features in developer betas instead of adding new features or making major changes. For instance, the Mood Tracking feature has seen a refinement in animations and slight tweaks. The Photos app now has a splash screen that lists the new features. Lastly, Apple has updated the wallpaper icon to an iOS 17 wallpaper. The iOS 17 update is expected to be announced in September, shortly after Apple launches the iPhone 15 series.

What Happened:\u00a0A patent granted earlier this week, titled \u201cLight Recognition Module for Determining a User of a Computing Device,\u201d has shed light on Apple\u2019s plans to integrate its Face ID\u2019s cutting-edge biometric authentication system into the tech giant\u2019s laptop and desktop lineup. It underscores the growing need for safeguarding sensitive data stored on these devices.\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0Apple To Settle \u2018Batterygate\u2019 Lawsuit With Total $500M Payout For Disgruntled iPhone Owners \u201cRecent advances in computing devices have enabled users to perform a variety of complex functions such as internet browsing, chatting, word processing, graphic design, video editing, and so forth. By performing these complex functions, sensitive data associated with these users may be gathered and/or stored by these computing devices,\u201d the patent read. \u00a0\u201cTo prevent unauthorized users from accessing this sensitive data, these computing devices may incorporate systems and mechanisms for authenticating users.\u201d The Cupertino, California-based tech giant\u2019s approach centers around a \u201clight pattern recognition module,\u201d which comprises a light emitter capable of projecting a specific light pattern and a light detector that interprets the reflected pattern from a user\u2019s face.\u00a0 Notably, the Face ID module will likely find its place within a designated partition, possibly in the form of a notch, circle, ellipse, or other shapes adjacent to or above the display,\u00a0reported\u00a0AppleInsider. While the patent primarily addresses MacBook models, a single illustration hints at the potential integration of the Face ID notch into an iMac-style chassis, suggesting broader applications for the technology.\u00a0 This move follows\u00a0Apple\u2019s historical trajectory, reminiscent of how Touch ID began on iPhones before expanding to iPads and MacBooks. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0It\u2019s crucial to remember that securing a patent doesn\u2019t serve as concrete evidence of an upcoming product launch.\u00a0 Nevertheless, given Apple\u2019s prior official declaration of extending Face ID to more devices and the striking resemblance with the progression of Touch ID, this technology may find its way into the Mac ecosystem, the report noted.\u00a0 If Face ID on your iPhone isn\u2019t working, try\u00a0following these steps.\u00a0 Image Credits \u2013 Shutterstock Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.\u00a0 Read Next:\u00a0Leaked Info About Apple iPhone Hints At Surprising Changes",

                "body": "Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani expressed his hope for the new redesign of the Apple Watch (NASDAQ:AAPL) stating that it will \u201cadd material value\u201d to the series, Barron\u2019s reports.  Apple is gearing up for a significant redesign in the upcoming Series X of the watch, which Bloomberg reported will follow the Series 9 lineup scheduled for this September. The new iteration in the X Series will boast fresh updates and features anticipated to fuel demand. Daryanani, bullish on Apple with a $210 price target, stated, \u201cThe Watch X is set to be the first major redesign in the device's history and we believe that not only will it be a major-enough redesign for older users to consider upgrading but also incrementally valuable in convincing users to switch from competitor models.\u201d Among the expected design alterations are a slimmer case, revamped band attachments and the introduction of blood-pressure monitoring tech. Apple has yet to comment on these speculations. Daryanani emphasized the potential of the blood pressure feature, noting its convenience compared to standalone monitors. He believes this addition could attract hypertension patients and even pave the way for insurance firms to subsidize the watch. For the third quarter, Apple\u2019s wearables, including watches, contributed $8.28 billion to the company\u2019s $81.8 billion total revenue.

                "body": "While Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is largely expected to equip the iPhone 15 with a USB-C port instead of the Lightning port, a new report suggests that iPhone fans have more to look forward to than just a new port. What Happened: The iPhone 15's USB-C port could support blazing-fast data transmission speeds allowing users to transfer enormous amounts of data at a much faster click, reported ChargerLab. See Also: iPhone 15 Pro May Be Faster Than The Fastest Android Phones, Chip Rumors Suggest Even better, buyers won't have to shell out for the most expensive iPhone 15 models either. While iPhone 15's USB-C connector parts have previously leaked, it wasn't known until now what chip was powering it. According to the report, the iPhone 15's USB-C port is powered by a Thunderbolt/USB 4.0 Retimer chip, allowing the phone to support data transfer speeds of up to 40 Gbps. Faster Than Lightning: For context, the existing iPhone 14 models with the Lightning port use the USB 2.0 protocol, which supports speeds of up to 480 Mbps. This is nearly 80 times slower than the iPhone 15's rumored 40 Gbps transfer speeds. The report claims that at least three models of the iPhone 15 \u2013 iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, and iPhone 15 Pro Max \u2013 have the USB-C port with the Retimer chip. Interestingly, the iPhone 15 Pro is missing from the list, but if the non-Pro models support it, likely, the iPhone 15 Pro will also support Thunderbolt/USB 4.0 speeds. The iPhone 15 Pro models are also expected to feature a titanium design and an Action Button borrowed from the Apple Watch Ultra. Apple is also expected to use the A17 Bionic chipset on the Pro models, while the non-Pro models will likely use the A16 Bionic chipset. We should know more about the iPhone 15 series in September when Apple is expected to launch them, alongside the Apple Watch 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.

We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) experienced a dip overnight but is currently trading above our crucial support level of 442.61. Bullish traders will aim for an upward movement, targeting the next levels at 443.42 and 443.90. If the momentum remains strong above 443.90 with significant buying activity, we could see a surge towards our top bullish target for the day at 445.08. Conversely, if 442.61 breaks under significant selling pressure and the 442.04 level is tested, we anticipate bearish traders to push the price towards 441.62. Our ultimate bearish target for the day stands at 441.06. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) remained stable overnight and are hovering just below our pivotal level of 366.69. Bullish traders will look for a clear upward momentum above 366.69, targeting 367.52. With continued buying, our top bullish target for the day is 368.57. If trading struggles to surpass 366.69, bearish forces might drive the price to 366.15. If this level proves fragile, a further decline to 365.59 could occur. In the event of a significant sell-off, our bearish target for the day is 364.65. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading slightly above our pivotal level of 177.31. On the upside, bullish traders are eyeing 178.61 as the next target, with the day's top bullish target at 179.36. On the downside, if 177.31 support falters, bearish momentum could push the price to 176.29. In the case of a significant decline, our bearish target is 175.81. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading just shy of our crucial support level of 321.51. Bullish traders aim to surpass this mark, targeting an upward move towards 323.17. With strong buying, we could see a move towards the day's top bullish target of 324.81. If 321.51 fails to hold, bearish momentum might drive the price to 320.05. In the event of intense selling, our bearish target for the day stands at 318.48. Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is trading slightly above our pivotal level of 129.52. If this support remains intact, bullish momentum could target 130.41, with the day's top target at 131.28. Conversely, if 129.52 doesn't hold, bearish forces might push the price to 128.91. The day's ultimate bearish target for Alphabet is 128.34. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) is hovering around our pivotal level of 300.23. Bullish traders will aim to maintain this as support, targeting an upward move to 301.71. On strong buying, our top bullish target for the day is 304.77. If 300.23 fails to hold, bearish momentum might drive the price to 297.33. A significant decline could test our ultimate bearish target for the day at 293.91. For NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), bullish traders will aim to secure and maintain 442.76 as support. If momentum remains positive, the price could target 447.05. With sustained buying, our top bullish target for the day is 450.04. If 442.76 fails to hold, bearish forces might drive the price to 439.87.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is negative.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "title": "In Love With Your Best Friend? Google's AI Life Coach Under Development Might Just Have The Answers",
                "body": "Google is reportedly creating an AI-enhanced life coach to offer solutions for users\u2019 personal challenges. With artificial intelligence at the center of tech developments, companies in Silicon Valley are racing to develop the tools that will become ubiquitous in the next AI-powered stage of computing. The life coach tool, which has not been officially released or announced by Google's parent company Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), came to light after The New York Times gained access to documents and other materials detailing its development. In late July, it became known that Google is working on upgrading its Assistant \u2014 which is comparable to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri \u2014 to include generative AI. Apple and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also working on upgrading their assistants with large language models to work as possible life companions. As a first step in that direction, Google announced in June an upcoming project called Tailwind, which would provide users with their own, personalized AI tool. The new development is reportedly coming from Google DeepMind, Alphabet's AI research unit, which is a result of the April merger of subsidiary DeepMind with Google's internal Ai research arm, called Brain. The outlet reported that Google DeepMind is developing \"at least 21 different types of personal and professional tasks, including tools to give users life advice, ideas, planning instructions and tutoring tips.\" People familiar with the matter who anonymously spoke to the outlet said that Scale AI, a third-party contractor hired by Google, has put together a team of experts in different fields to train the model and test its responses. At least 100 of the newly hired workforce are PhD-level experts. The tool is being developed to answer intimate questions, such as advising on conversations with a friend whose overseas wedding one can\u2019t attend due to financial constraints. The model would also include a tutoring function that can help users learn new skills, improve existing ones, help develop a financial budget, improve one's running scores or develop a meal plan. If the development gets a release date, it could give Google an edge over Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which became the unlikely leader in the AI-chat sphere by being an early adopter of the technology on its search engine Bing. Microsoft is facing a PR crisis as it became known that the company is storing all chats from non-paying customers. Bard, which is Google's available AI assistant, is currently barred by Google from providing financial or medical advice in an effort to steer away from legal trouble.\u00a0 Also read: Is Google Bard Better Than ChatGPT? 8 Capabilities Exclusive To OpenAI\u2019s Chatbot Rival Bard will also avoid providing legal advice, instead directing the user to resources where answers can be found. When users ask Bard legal questions, it will provide a disclaimer: \"I am not a lawyer, and I cannot provide legal advice. If you need specific legal advice, you should consult with a qualified lawyer.\" However, Bard does provide answers to personal questions such as what to do if one's in love with their best friend, how to become better at work or what's a good meal plan. The tool, however, only provides answers to specific questions and does not track their development. In spite of the hype, the new life coach might never get a release date. A spokesperson for Google DeepMind told The NY Times that \"isolated samples of evaluation data are not representative of our product road map.\" The person referred to the data being examined by Scale AI and said that Google has \"long worked with a variety of partners to evaluate our research and products across Google, which is a critical step in building safe and helpful technology. At any time there are many such evaluations ongoing.\" A former Google officer said last week that he expects AI to become one billion times smarter than humans by 2045.

Here are the top two stories related to the tech giant: U.S. Court Clears Path for iPhone Settlement Payments:\u00a0 The United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has given the go-ahead for payments to be disbursed to members of a class action lawsuit against Apple.\u00a0 The lawsuit alleged that Apple intentionally reduced the performance of iPhones with older batteries.\u00a0 In a settlement reached in March 2020, Apple consented to pay between $310 million to $500 million. Eligible iPhone owners who filed claims before the October 2020 deadline are set to receive around $65.\u00a0 This settlement follows accusations from 2018 where Apple was alleged to have slowed down iPhone performance due to battery wear, a claim which Apple refuted,\u00a0ABC7 News\u00a0reports. Apple's Stance on U.K.'s Online Safety Bill:\u00a0 The U.K.'s Online Safety Bill has stirred concerns among major tech companies, including Apple. The legislation, aimed at safeguarding children from harmful online content, mandates tech companies to provide backdoor access, potentially compromising encryption.\u00a0 Transitioning from decentralized peer-to-peer encryption to a centralized system could introduce vulnerabilities in private communications.\u00a0 Apple has voiced its reservations, indicating a preference to withdraw services like FaceTime and iMessage from the U.K. rather than compromise their security.\u00a0 Engineers might face challenges adapting to the loss of decentralized messaging, leading to potential alternative solutions such as integrating messaging systems within IoT apps or resorting to VPN networks,\u00a0Techradar\u00a0reports.

                "title": "Apple's Winning Game Plan? Analyst Tells Why 'Golden ESPN Assets' Could Be The 'Shoe That Fits' Cupertino",
                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been aggressively looking to make a splash in live sports coverage, and an analyst at Wedbush thinks this could result in the tech giant lapping up Walt Disney Co.-owned (NYSE:DIS) ESPN. Live Sports A Serious Opportunity: Apple has come to realize that adding live sports content onto its Apple TV streaming platform is the \u201cgolden goose strategy\u201d to increase subscribers going forward, said analyst Daniel Ives in a note. Apple TV+ currently has over 50 million paid subscribers on its platform, he noted. The subscription number, the analyst said, got a boost from the company's 10-year Major League Soccer, or MLS, streaming deal when Lionel Messi signed with Inter Miami. This \u201cgame-changing\u201d move has massively catalyzed the number of MLS Season Pass subscriptions around the world, he added. Apple's Pac-12 TV deal talks to secure media rights to college football broadcasts on Apple TV have reportedly fallen through, the analyst noted. \u201cThe massive appetite for live sports content remains the laser focus for Cupertino now to boost its streaming future and further tap into its massive installed base of 2 billion iOS devices worldwide,\u201d Ives said. \u201cWe believe the answer and the shoe that fits for Apple is the golden ESPN assets which potentially may be on the table in one form or another,\u201d he said, adding Disney CEO Bob Iger and the board will likely strategically look at the Mouse House's core assets over the coming months. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock ESPN Best Fit? ESPN, according to Ives, is more attractive to Apple than Disney. \u201cApple recognizes that in this streaming arms race, there is a \u2018closing window' for the stalwart to acquire content and cement its footing in the live sports content arena,\u201d he said. Acquiring Disney may not make sense for Apple as it is currently focused on a number of other key strategic initiatives, Ives said. But acquiring ESPN, which might carry a price tag of over $50 billion, would make a ton of strategic sense, he said. With a potential ESPN acquisition, Apple stands to gain valuable sports content and major TV rights across each of the major professional and college sports packages, the analyst said. It would also \u201cchange the cross-sell opportunities and attractiveness of Apple TV looking ahead while putting Apple on the sports map globally,\u201d he added. Delving on another factor in favor of a potential deal, Ives said Apple CEO Tim Cook and Iger share a strong relationship. At a minimum, they could agree on major distribution partnership rights between Apple TV and ESPN that will likely help both platforms in a number of ways over the coming years, he said. The analyst, however, pointed to antitrust concerns. There are many complicating factors including a hawkish Federal Trade Commission and the commission's Chair Lina Khan, he said. Despite all the pushbacks, Apple could now seriously pursue ESPN in its efforts to gain much-needed live sports content, he said. Ives has an Outperform rating and a $230 price target on Apple shares. Apple closed Wednesday's session at $176.57, down 0.50%, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Live Translate on Pixel phones is powered by AI and the custom Tensor chipset designed by Google. Soccer Or Football? The iPhone tries to make a comeback, saying, \"I'm fluent in the one language the whole world understands.\" \"What's that, iPhone?\", asks Pixel. \"Soccer,\" the iPhone responds. That kicks off a long debate between the Pixel and the iPhone \u2013 while Pixel tries to win the argument by translating the word \"football\" into several languages, the iPhone sticks to soccer. All said and done, it's a fun segment, thanks to the banter. Besides, who doesn't want to see two phones playing football.. err, soccer.

                "body": "At the Def Con 2023 conference for hackers and cybersecurity professionals, attendees saw an alarming potential security risk. Thanks to researcher Jae Bochs\u2019 initiative that showcased a mere $70 device that could exploit Bluetooth vulnerabilities in Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices. What happened: Combined with elements like a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a Linux-compatible Bluetooth adapter, and other components, the device taps into Apple\u2019s Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) system. In BLE, devices transmit brief messages, known as Advertising Packets, to signal their presence and features to other devices nearby. See Also: Faster Than Lightning: iPhone 15\u2019s USB-C Port Could Support Blazing Fast Data Transfer Speeds As Bochs walked around the conference, he could send deceptive alerts to iPhones nearby. These alerts tricked users into believing they needed to input their passwords into a nonexistent Apple TV. While Bochs\u2019 purpose wasn\u2019t to steal information but to educate, the experiment underlined that such a device could gather user information if deployed with evil intent. The demo shared in the video by Techcrunch was a compelling reminder that personal data is potentially vulnerable even in specialized settings. Moreover, although Apple has been aware of this potential risk since 2019, they still need to address it.\u00a0 The BLE is crucial for Apple\u2019s product ecosystem, allowing different devices to interact seamlessly. However, Bochs believes Apple could improve by providing users with more transparent Bluetooth setting information. Bochs\u2019 demonstration at Def Con 2023 is a stark reminder of the intricate dance between innovation and security in the digital world. As tech companies like Apple continue pushing the envelope for seamless user experience, there must be parallel efforts to improve safety. Consumers are also responsible for staying aware and attentive. How to be safe: Awareness is key to countering such threats. Users need to recognize the devices they carry, their functions, and typical notifications. Random prompts for passwords, especially from unrecognized devices, should be dealt with suspicion are better ignored. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

                "body": "Smartphones have been getting more expensive for a while now, and that trend is likely to continue in the near future, too. From Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 series to Google Pixel 8 series and Samsung's Galaxy S24, most upcoming flagships are expected to see a price hike. What Happened: Despite a decline in smartphone shipments \u2013 worse in the case of Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Android phones than Apple, upcoming flagships are expected to get even more expensive. See Also: Faster Than Lightning: iPhone 15\u2019s USB-C Port Could Support Blazing Fast Data Transfer Speeds Apple is largely expected to hike the prices of its iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max by $100, but other reports suggest that we could see a price hike of up to $200. With that said, a $100 hike has wider consensus, and it's also Apple's first price hike in a long time \u2013 Apple hasn't hiked the price of its \u2018Pro Max' iPhones since first introducing them in 2018. Tipster Yogesh Brar had earlier suggested that Google's Pixel 8 series is expected to start at a higher price point of $649, up from Pixel 7's $599 starting price. Now, Samsung's Galaxy S24 series, set to launch in early 2024, is also expected to get more expensive, but given that its launch is still a few months away, there's not much dough on it yet. Situation Worse In The Android World: While Android phones have gotten expensive, too, it could get worse in the coming months. The upcoming Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset is rumored to be priced \"a bit high\". This will directly impact upcoming Android flagship phones from Samsung, OnePlus, and others. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2's higher price has already driven up the prices of the current generation of Android flagships \u2013 Samsung's Galaxy S23 series has seen a price hike in some markets, although it has remained the same in the US. However, that could change with the Galaxy S24 series. Some Android makers are reportedly considering sticking with the older Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset even in 2024, but it remains to be seen how everything pans out. All said and done, flagship phones getting more expensive is a trend that will likely continue for the foreseeable future.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) has experienced an overnight gap up, recovering some of yesterday's downturn. It's currently trading just above our pivotal support level of 441.06. Bulls will aim for an upward movement, targeting the next level at 441.62. If momentum remains strong above this, we anticipate the bulls taking charge, pushing towards 442.04. The day's top bullish target stands at 442.61. Conversely, if 441.62 isn't secured by bullish forces, we expect the bears to challenge the 441.06 support. If sellers dominate, the price might descend to 440.34. A significant decline could test our strong support at 439.66, with the day's ultimate bearish target at 438.78. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) have seen a slight overnight gap up and are hovering just above our pivotal level of 363.23. Bulls will look for a clear upward momentum above this mark, targeting 364.65. With continued buying, our top bullish target for the day is 366.69. If trading struggles to maintain above 363.23, bearish forces might drive the price to 361.41. If this level proves fragile, a further decline to 360.08 could occur. In the event of a significant sell-off, our bearish target for the day is 357.94. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading slightly above our level of 176.84. On the upside, bullish traders are eyeing 177.31 as the next target, with the day's top bullish target at 178.18. On the downside, if 176.84 support falters, bearish momentum could push the price to 176.29. In the case of a significant decline, our bearish target is 175.81. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading just above our crucial support level of 320.05. Bullish traders aim to maintain this mark, targeting an upward move towards 321.51. With strong buying, we could see a move towards the day's top bullish target of 323.17. If 320.05 fails to hold, bearish momentum might drive the price to 318.48. In the event of intense selling, our bearish target for the day stands at 316.04. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) is hovering above our pivotal level of 293.91. Bullish traders will aim to maintain this as support, targeting an upward move to 295.97. If momentum remains positive, the price could target the upper end of the channel at 297.33. Our top bullish target for the day is 300.23. If 293.91 fails to hold, bearish momentum might drive the price to 291.18. A significant decline could test our ultimate bearish target for the day at 288.87. For NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), bullish traders will aim to secure and maintain 439.87 as support. If momentum remains positive, the price could target 442.76. With sustained buying, our top bullish target for the day is 447.05. If 439.87 fails to hold, bearish forces might drive the price to 436.56. Intense selling could test our support at 434.01, with the day's ultimate bearish target at 432.36.

Note the following: In a separate development, for the first time in 2023, market makers are gamma hedged.\u00a0This is a major development, and prudent investors should pay attention.\u00a0The reason is that about two thirds of the magnitude of the stock market rally in 2023 is attributable to market mechanics.\u00a0One of the market mechanics that has helped the stock market run up is short gamma squeeze.\u00a0For those who want to understand this deeply, there is a new podcast titled \u201cMarket Mechanics: Impact Of Dealers\u2019 Gamma Position Change On The Stock Market\u201d in post production.\u00a0The podcast will be available in Arora Ambassador Club.\u00a0The club has several other podcasts to help you understand market mechanics in-depth. Initial jobless came at 239K vs. 240K consensus. This is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive\u00a0ZYX Asset Allocation Model\u00a0with inputs in\u00a0ten categories.\u00a0In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions.\u00a0Please\u00a0click here\u00a0to see how this is achieved.\u00a0One of the reasons behind The Arora Report\u2019s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model.\u00a0Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change. In the early trade, money flows are positive in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In the early trade, money flows are negative in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). In the early trade, money flows are mixed in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\u00a0and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ). The momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade.\u00a0Smart money is inactive in the early trade. The momo crowd is buying gold in the early trade.\u00a0Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV).\u00a0 The momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade.\u00a0Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see oil ratings. The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (NYSE:USO). Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has fallen below $29,000. Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is neutral.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\u00a0To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0 If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.\u00a0The Arora Report correctly called the 2008 financial crash, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, the COVID crash, the post-COVID bull market, and the 2022 bear market.\u00a0 Please click here to sign up for a free forever Generate Wealth Newsletter.

                "body": "China\u2019s internet regulator is reportedly trying to ease fears about its latest data law regulations by reaching out to foreign companies. The regulator has reached out to firms including\u00a0Walmart Inc\u00a0(NYSE:WMT) and\u00a0PayPal Holdings Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:PYPL), reported\u00a0Bloomberg. The report added that Cyberspace Administration of China officials met executives of dozens of International firms to allay concerns about the new data regime. The officials provided guidance on rules adherence procedures and acknowledged the difficulties in getting approvals for overseas transfers of sensitive information. Beijing\u2019s new data rules provide President Xi Jinping\u2019s administration the capacity to fine or shut down companies that are found to mishandle sensitive data. \u201cYour systems will be blocked in China or you will not be able to carry on transferring Chinese personal data outside of China if you do not comply,\u201d the report quoted Carolyn Bigg, head of DLA Piper\u2019s data privacy and cybersecurity teams in Asia. This has sparked fears among foreign companies leading to modifications in their operations.\u00a0Morgan Stanley\u00a0(NYSE:MS) reportedly shifted about 200 of its tech developers out of mainland China. The government will help Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and the Greater Bay Area to come up with a list of data that can be exported. Financial institutions, automakers, electronics firms and consumer retailers are among the major multinationals in the country. Some of the large names include\u00a0General Motors Company\u00a0(NYSE:GM),\u00a0Volkswagen AG\u00a0(OTC:VWAGY),\u00a0Tesla Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA),\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL),\u00a0Starbucks Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:SBUX) and\u00a0Intel Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:INTC). \u201cIt\u2019s hard to face up to the consequence of having to entirely stop data flows and the impact that that has on being able to service your China customers,\u201d said Carolyn Bigg.

                "body": "Global smartphone shipments\u00a0are heading for their worst performance in a decade, primarily impacted by challenges in the U.S. and China.\u00a0 In a contrasting scenario,\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands a chance to emerge as the dominant player in\u00a0the smartphone market, buoyed by the steady demand for its premium iPhone line, CNBC\u00a0cites\u00a0a Counterpoint Research report. Also Read:\u00a0Apple iPhone 16 Pro Could Go Big On Cameras And Wireless Connectivity Shipments vs. Sales Shipments differ from sales because they signify the number of devices smartphone manufacturers dispatch to sellers. Counterpoint Research projects a 6% year-on-year slump in smartphone shipments in 2023, totaling 1.15 billion devices. \u00a0 Factors At Play Challenges in Asia, particularly in China, have posed significant hurdles. While China was likely to witness an economic revival, its performance has been underwhelming.\u00a0 Once boasting an average smartphone purchase of 450 million units annually, the figures have now plummeted to 270 million. North America, especially the U.S., also played a part in hampering global recovery. \u00a0 Apple's Robust Stance High-end smartphones have generally weathered the downturn, with Apple leading the way. The forthcoming launch of the iPhone 15 in September is likely to bolster Apple's position further.\u00a0 The release provides a crucial opportunity for carriers to attract valuable customers, setting Apple on a favorable path. Despite the challenging market conditions, Apple's shipments will likely witness a minor uptick due to the\u00a0rising demand in markets\u00a0like China, where consumers increasingly gravitate towards premium devices. There's an ongoing tussle for the top position between Apple and\u00a0Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd\u00a0(OTC:SSNLF).\u00a0 If Apple maintains its current trajectory and steers clear of production issues, it could outpace Samsung, capturing the\u00a0highest market share. Apple's focus on emerging markets,\u00a0especially India, is also noteworthy. The company made significant inroads into the Indian market in 2023, marking its presence with the inauguration of its first physical stores and a visit from CEO Tim Cook.\u00a0 The success of the iPhone 15 and Apple's growth in untapped iPhone markets will be pivotal in determining its global standing.

                "body": "Wedbush\u00a0analyst\u00a0Daniel Ives\u00a0recently weighed in on the trajectory of\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), highlighting the tech titan's strategic moves to dominate the live sports streaming arena.\u00a0 As Apple pushes its boundaries to escalate its subscriber count on the Apple TV streaming platform, its endeavors in the live sports sphere, especially following the landmark 10-year streaming contract with MLS after Lionel Messi's iconic transition to Inter Miami, have caught attention. Ives hints at a noticeable spike in global MLS Season Pass subscriptions, attributing it to Messi's impact.\u00a0 While this is a significant advancement, Apple's broader strategic vision might target an even bigger fish - ESPN.\u00a0 The network's comprehensive sports coverage and vast TV rights could be a lucrative venture for Apple. Ives believes securing ESPN, which might be valued north of $50 billion, aligns more with Apple's aspirations than a potential acquisition of\u00a0Disney\u00a0(NYSE:DIS).\u00a0 A Change in Acquisition Stance? Historically, Apple, under the leadership of Tim Cook, has been conservative with substantial acquisitions. A classic example is their most significant buy - the $3 billion+ Beats deal in 2014.\u00a0 However, Ives suggests that the rapidly transforming market dynamics might nudge Apple to recalibrate its approach.\u00a0 Aligning with ESPN, be it via acquisition or a strategic partnership, might be the game-changer Apple needs further to cement its stronghold in the live sports content space. Ives reiterated Apple with an Outperform and a\u00a0$230 price target. Citi's Analysis of Apple Parallelly,\u00a0Citi\u00a0analyst\u00a0Atif Malik\u00a0holds an optimistic stance on Apple.

                "title": "Why This Tesla Analyst Refuses To Let Go Of Stock Despite Mega-Cap Peer Pressure: 'Please Don't Tell Me To Sell \u2026'",
                "body": "Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell for the fifth consecutive session on Thursday as macroeconomic worries roiled the market. More importantly, the stock has receded about 25% since the electric vehicle giant reported its second-quarter results on July 19. Much of the weakness is self-inflicted, according to Future Fund Managing Director Gary Black. Tesla Vs. Mega-Cap Tech Peers: Black shared a chart that highlighted Tesla's underperformance over the past month versus Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NASDAQ) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). The QQQ is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of the 100 biggest tech companies. For those who stubbornly cling to the notion that $TSLA price cuts are somehow good for TSLA valuation, look at $TSLA stock vs peers since TSLA's July 19 conf call, when Elon alarmed investors by warning that he would cut EV prices if int rates continued to rise. pic.twitter.com/uYugnHDZjo See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock Price Cuts Cop The Blame: Black repeated his view that the underperformance is due to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's comments regarding more imminent vehicle price cuts on the second-quarter earnings call. Musk walked the talk, with his flagship EV venture announcing price cuts for its Model Y vehicles in China. Cutting configurator prices is different from bringing down inventory vehicle prices, Black said. Unlike lowering inventory prices, when there is a sense of urgency to capitalize, lowering configurator prices does not send out a sense of urgency, he said. \u201cThe lower price is always there,\u201d he added. \u201cWorse, TSLA is training consumers to think that if they wait, another price cut will come along,\u201d Black said. Bottom Line At Risk: With price cuts, Tesla's demand is pulled forward and future demand falls as actual demand elasticity is low, Black said. Tesla's average selling price, excluding regulatory credit, has declined 20% year-over-year globally from $56,000 to $45,000, the fund manager said. He also noted that Wall Street's volume estimates are now at 1.843 million, fractionally lower than the year-end. \u201cThis demand elasticity causes Street earnings estimates to plunge,\u201d he said, adding that the 2023 EPS has fallen 36% year-to-date and 41% year-over-year. The Tesla management doesn't seem to have other tools in its toolkit to balance short-term supply and demand, Black said. Light At End Of Tunnel? One positive for Tesla is the increasing EV adoption globally, Black said, adding that the company will be the biggest beneficiary. \u201cTSLA has the best product, the most advanced autonomy, the most visionary CEO, and is moving quickly to expand its TAM by entering two huge segments \u2013 pickups and the $25K-$30K segment where all the customers are,\u201d he said. Future Fund has Tesla as its second-biggest holding. \u201cPlease don't tell me to sell my TSLA position,\u201d Black said. He required the management team and board to take a \u201clonger-term view in running its business and invest in educating current legacy auto consumers why they should go EV rather than cutting price.\u201d Tesla ended Thursday\u2019s session down 2.83% at $219.22, according to Benzinga Pro data. This marked the lowest closing price since June 5. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.

So in maximum cases, the hero will have an iPhone, not the villain.\u00a0\u00a0 Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0A 2021\u00a0report\u00a0from The Wall Street Journal found that in about 74 episodes of Apple TV+, characters got their hands on around 300 iPhones, 120 MacBooks, and 40 pairs of AirPods.\u00a0 Filmmaker\u00a0Rian Johnson\u00a0also dropped a hint \u2013 if you don\u2019t see an iPhone with a character, it might mean they\u2019re up to no good in the story, giving away a surprise twist. In some shows, characters even mention wanting to buy Apple stock, but these placements are done so smoothly that users might not notice.\u00a0 For the unversed, \u201cproduct placement\u201d means a company pays to show its product in a TV show or movie. Companies sometimes also pay for characters to mention their products subtly, like\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0Bing.\u00a0 Photo by Framesira on Shutterstock Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed Thursday\u2019s session down 1.46% amid increasing fears the U.S. is headed toward another series of interest rate hikes into the end of the year as inflation remains stubborn. The move lower came on higher-than-average volume, which acts as a warning sign for investors. Volume is the total number of shares traded in a security within a specific period of time. It\u2019s a momentum indicator used by technical traders to gauge overall interest and sentiment in a stock. Volume is also used as an indicator to confirm a trend or trend change. When bullish trading volume increases, the share price of a\u00a0stock usually moves higher whereas increasing bearish volume, when a stock is in a downtrend, usually pushes the price lower. In contrast, lower-than-average trading volume usually indicates consolidation which results in the stock trading sideways. Apple\u2019s tumble on higher-than-average volume dragged the S&P 500 lower, which caused volatility in the stock market to increase. Traders wishing to play the potential volatility in the stock market can use MIAX\u2019s SPIKES Volatility products. The products, which are traded on SPIKES Volatility Index (XMIO: SPIKE), track expected volatility in the SPY over the next 30 days. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge!

                "body": "Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 is rumored to support up to 30% faster charging speeds, thanks to the highly anticipated USB-C port that is expected to debut this year on iPhones. What Happened: Apple could give the iPhone 15 charging speeds a boost of up to 30%, increasing it from 27W to 35W. All this is thanks to the USB-C port that the company's upcoming flagship is likely to use, ditching the Lightning port, reported 9to5Mac. See Also: Google Is Adding One Of The Best iPhone Features To Android 14, And This App Has The First Traces Of It Now Some iPhone 15 models are likely to get the fast charging boost, but it's unclear which of them will support 35W charging. We expect the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max to support it, but the third could be any of the two non-Pro models. Not The First Time: This is not the first time that it has been rumored that the iPhone 15 models will support faster charging speeds \u2013 noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said last year that he expects Apple to switch to the USB-C port in 2023, which could also boost the charging speeds. So far, it is widely expected that the iPhone 15 series will switch to the USB-C port and ditch the Lightning port. Earlier this week, another finding revealed that this port could supercharge iPhone 15's data transfer speeds to up to 40Gbps. The iPhone 15 Pro models are also expected to feature a titanium design and an Action Button borrowed from the Apple Watch Ultra. Apple is also expected to use the A17 Bionic chipset on the Pro models, while the non-Pro models will likely use the A16 Bionic chipset. However, there could be a $100 price hike as well. The iPhone 15 series is expected to launch on September 12. We should know more about Apple's upcoming flagships then.

The upcoming iPhone 15 series could make its job easier, even as smartphone shipments are slowing down. What Happened: Market research first Counterpoint has revealed that Apple is a few days of sales away from becoming the world's top smartphone company. See Also: iPhone 15 Could Charge Up To 30% Faster, Thanks To The USB-C Port \"It's the closest Apple's been to the top spot.\u00a0We're talking about a spread that's literally a few days' worth of sales,\" said Jeff Fieldhack, Research Director for North America. This is despite an expected slowdown in iPhone demand \u2013 Apple's lens supplier Sony isn't very excited about iPhone 15 demand, citing a slower-than-expected recovery in the Chinese market and worsening conditions in the US. These two markets are amongst Apple's biggest, which could pose a risk to Apple reaching the top spot. However, the analysts at Counterpoint are more optimistic about Apple's changes, saying that barring production issues, the company's chances look the brightest amongst the key smartphone makers. New Era For Apple? The weak macroeconomic conditions worldwide could make 2023 amongst the worst for the global smartphone industry. However, for Apple, this could be a new era. \"2023 could mark the start of a new era for Apple as a resilient premium market and strong showing in the US could help it become number one globally in terms of annual shipments for the first time ever,\" the firm said. For context, iPhone sales in the US fell only 6% year-on-year in the June quarter, while the situation was over six times worse for other companies \u2013 Android makers saw a 38% decline in sales in the same period. Will Apple become the world's top smartphone maker and dethrone Samsung? We should know in a few months' time.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, TSLA, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: The SPY (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0has experienced a gap down overnight, with significant premarket selling as we head into Friday's session. Currently, it's hovering just above our 434.13 marker. Bulls will aim to push upwards, targeting an initial level of 434.66. If momentum persists above 435.06, we anticipate a bullish drive towards 435.59. The day's peak bullish target is set at 436.51. Conversely, if 434.13 doesn't hold, we expect the bears to challenge 433.75. Should sellers dominate, a descent to 433.27 is likely. A significant breach here, especially with heavy selling, could test our robust support at 432.91. In the event of an intense bearish session, our ultimate target is 431.78. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) have witnessed a sharp decline overnight, currently trading around our pivotal 355.93 level. Bulls will seek to establish dominance above 356.83. If this level remains unbreached, we could see an ascent towards 357.94. With sustained buying, our top bullish target for the day is 361.41. If trading struggles to maintain above 355.93, bearish forces might drive the price to 355.32. If this level proves fragile, a further decline to 354.24 is possible, with a deeper descent targeting 353.50. In the event of a significant sell-off, our bearish target for the day is 352.55. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen a decline in the overnight session, currently trading slightly below 172.35. On the upside, bulls are eyeing 173.24, with the day's peak bullish target at 174.05. On the downside, if the decline persists, we're looking at a potential rejection of 172.35, pushing the price to 171.66. If sellers remain aggressive, a descent to 171.03 is likely. In the case of a significant decline, our bearish target is 169.95. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) hovers just below our 313.61 support level. Bulls aim to reclaim this mark, with an upward trajectory targeting 316.04. Strong buying could push towards the day's peak bullish target of 318.48. If 313.61 fails to hold, bearish momentum might drive the price to 311.91. In the event of intense selling, our bearish target for the day stands at 309.38. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) is trading below our 280.96 marker. Bulls will aim to reclaim this, pushing towards 284.18. If momentum persists, 285.10 could come into play, with the day's peak bullish target at 286.94. If 280.96 doesn't hold, we anticipate a bearish descent to 279.15. A significant breach here could see 276.76, with our ultimate bearish target for the day at 273.68. Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) is maintaining support around 213.89. Bulls will aim for an upward trajectory, targeting 215.15. With sustained momentum, we could see 217.78, with the day's peak bullish target at 219.39. If 213.89 fails to hold, bearish forces might drive the price to 213.16. Intense selling could push towards 211.53, with the day's ultimate bearish target at 208.48. For NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), the focus is on the 426.17 support level. If buyers dominate, we could see an ascent to 429.17. Persistent buying could push towards 432.36, with the day's peak bullish target at 434.01. If 426.17 doesn't hold, we anticipate a bearish descent to 424.83. Intense selling could push towards 421.35, with our ultimate bearish target for the day at 419.36. Final Word: Today's trading landscape is devoid of significant data, but the spotlight will be on the monthly options contracts set to expire. This could lead to heightened volatility and potential sharp moves. Stay vigilant, trade wisely, and aim for a strong finish to the week. Best of luck!

Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 3\ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12.

The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

                "body": "Taiwan's\u00a0economic momentum appears\u00a0to be faltering, with recent figures hinting at the possibility of subdued growth for this year. Amidst the global decline in electronics demand, the nation's economic trajectory seems set to be its least impressive since 2015. Official figures disclosed by the government's statistical division present a sobering picture, Bloomberg\u00a0reports.\u00a0 Previously, an optimistic growth of 2.04% was anticipated for 2023. However, Friday's announcements marked the third consecutive time the projection was scaled down, this time to 1.61%. Also Read:\u00a0Taiwan Semiconductor Stock Falls After Q2 Earnings - How Did It Perform? Reflecting the Global Electronics Downtrend The nation's export forecast also took a hit, now projected to decline by 9.51%, steeper than the prior estimate of a 7.27% fall.\u00a0 Furthermore, consumers should brace themselves for a price hike, as the inflation rate will likely hover around 2.14%, a slight moderation from the earlier 2.26% prediction. The numbers for the second quarter mirror the overarching trend. The economy's growth for April-June stood at 1.36%, revised from the preliminary 1.45% figure, spelling challenges for the government, especially with the looming presidential elections in January.\u00a0 A sub-2% growth could equip the opposition with critiques against the current Democratic Progressive Party candidate and Vice President,\u00a0Lai Ching-te. Economists Weigh In Interestingly, according to a Bloomberg survey, some experts have an even grimmer outlook. They project a mere 0.9% growth, the weakest since the 2009 financial crisis.\u00a0Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co\u00a0(NYSE:TSM), the nation's flagship firm, has already signaled caution by trimming its annual revenue outlook.\u00a0 The critical\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) and\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier expressed skepticism about the longevity and sustainability of the anticipated surge in AI chips demand. In June, TSMC cut its 2023 capital expenditure outlook to closer to the bottom end of the previously forecast $32 billion - $36 billion range. TSMC reaffirmed projections for revenue in the first half of 2023 to decline by about 10% in U.S. dollar terms. The contract chipmaker also reaffirmed a low- to mid-single-digit revenue decline in 2023\u00a0 Meanwhile, China - Taiwan's predominant export destination, showed scant signs of buoyancy. Chinese authorities have resorted to rate cuts to stave off an economic downturn.\u00a0 In tandem, there have been concerted efforts to stabilize the financial markets, currently rocked by disappointing economic indicators, a slackening property market, and shadow lending\u00a0sector\u00a0turmoil. Price Action:\u00a0TSM shares traded lower by 1.00% at $90.72 on the last check Friday.

Here's a look at what's going on.  What To Know: Last week, the 9th District U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an appeal in the case brought by consumers accusing the company of sabotaging the performance of older iPhone models. The court\u2019s decision cleared the way for Apple to compensate iPhone users as part of the case settlement.\u00a0Approximately 3 million claims were submitted by iPhone users, and the total settlement is estimated to be between $310 million and $500 million. On Friday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reiterated Apple with an Outperform and maintained a $230 price target on AAPL. AAPL stock continues to be a favorite among retail investors and is currently one of the top trending tickers on WallStreetBets and Yahoo!

                "body": "As market turbulence sweeps across sectors, Apple Inc. (NYSE:AAPL) is not immune. The tech giant\u2019s stock has encountered double-digit declines in August, resulting in a staggering loss of around $400 billion in market capitalization. With nine trading sessions still to go, August has proven to be the worst month of the year so far for the iPhone maker. Adding to the gloom, Apple is currently facing a three-week losing streak, a situation not seen since the final days of December 2022. Apple\u2019s latest price action has been under the spotlight of traders using technical analysis to support their decisions.  The popular Relative Strength Index (RSI), calculated based on the past 14 daily closing prices, which is typically seen as a key momentum barometer, has plunged into oversold territory (below 30) for the first time this year.  The swift slide in Apple\u2019s stock prompted a sharp breach below the average price of the past 100 days. Such a move hadn\u2019t occurred since November 2022, signaling a significant shift in market sentiment. Read also: What is RSI? Apple 1-day Chart: Moving Averages, RSI, And Fibonacci Analysis Despite some timid buying interest observed on Friday, propelling Apple\u2019s stock by a modest 0.2%, the RSI\u2019s position in oversold territory implies that sellers continue to have the upper hand in the short term. Attention is now focused on the pivotal support level at $161. This price point corresponds to the current 200-day moving average and marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement level between the highest and lowest prices observed in 2023. If Apple\u2019s stock experiences a decisive decline and breaches the halfway point of its 2023 bullish trajectory, it could raise further bearish concerns.  A potential drop to $152.40, marking the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, can\u2019t be excluded, and such a scenario would signal the entry into a bear market, reflecting a downturn of over 20% from July\u2019s high. Notably, Apple\u2019s last bear market began exactly a year ago on Aug. 18, 2022, reaching a maximum 30% drawdown on Jan. 3, 2023. For now, the technical outlook leans toward a bearish perspective, as we await stronger bullish signals that could shift the market sentiment.  To challenge the prevailing short-term bearish momentum, Apple\u2019s stock must overcome the resistance at the 100-day moving average ($178) and successfully break above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $180.68.  On the other hand, a promising bullish reversal signal might arise if prices set a fresh low while the RSI shifts to an upward trajectory, indicating a weakening of bearish momentum.  Investors should remain attentive to upcoming events in the following week, as China-related headlines and the Jackson Hole symposium could exacerbate market volatility.

                "title": "If You Bet $100 On Lionel Messi To Score In His First 6 MLS Games, Here's How Much You Could Have Made",
                "body": "Soccer superstar Lionel Messi\u00a0joined Major League Soccer's\u00a0Inter Miami in a move that came as a surprise to many. In his first two games playing for Miami, Messi\u00a0scored three goals and had\u00a0one assist. Here\u2019s a look at how bettors have done backing the Argentine superstar. What Happened: Messi made his debut for Inter Miami in the Leagues Cup, with Inter Miami facing off against Cruz Azul on July 21. In the game, Messi came on as a substitute and scored the game-winning goal for Inter Miami, which\u00a0won 2-1. Messi drew his first start for Inter Miami on July 25,\u00a0with Inter Miami defeating Atlanta United 4-0. In the game, Messi had two goals and an assist. Bettors who wagered on Messi to score a\u00a0goal at any point would have cashed bets in both games. Bettors who took their winnings from the first game and rolled them into the second Messi match would have done even better. Bettors could have continued this trend, with Messi continuing to find the back of the net and helping Inter Miami advance to the Leagues Cup Finals. Through his first six games with Inter Miami, Messi has nine goals and three assists, scoring in each game. In the six games Messi has played with Inter Miami, the team has 21 goals. That\u2019s compared to 22 goals scored in the team\u2019s 22 regular season MLS games last season when it was without Messi. Here\u2019s a look at how rolling the $100 bet on Messi to score a goal would have done each game and how much it would be worth today. Betting odds vary by sportsbook.\u00a0The\u00a0following odds were from DraftKings: Game 1 vs. Cruz Azul: -125, $100 into $180, profit of $80 Game 2 vs. Atlanta United: -120, $180 into $330, profit of $150 Game 3 vs. Orlando City: -135, $330 into $574, profit of $244 Game 4 vs. FC Dallas: -155, $574 into $944, profit of $370 Game 5 vs. Charlotte FC: -225, $944 into $1,364, profit of $420 Game 6 vs. Philadelphia Union: -150, $1,364 into $2,273, profit of $909 A bettor who wagered $100 on Messi to score a goal in all six games using the initial bet and rolling the winnings into the next game would now have $2,273 and be up 2,173%. Not a bad return for backing a superstar. Related Link: Lionel Messi Impact: Inter Miami Dominating Social Media, Jersey Sales, Tickets And More\u00a0 What\u2019s Next: Messi\u2019s next game is the Leagues Cup Finals where Inter Miami takes on Nashville at 9 p.m. ET on Saturday, Aug. 19. Inter Miami is favored to win at odds of -110 on\u00a0DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG). Nashville is the underdog at odds of +260, and the draw is listed at +285. A draw in regulation would see the game decided in extra time, including a possible penalty shootout. Messi has odds of a goal scored at any point in the match at -135. To watch the game, you\u2019ll need to have signed up for MLS Season Pass on\u00a0AppleTV. Apple Inc\u00a0landed the exclusive rights to MLS games in a 10-year deal valued at a reported $2.5 billion. The contract began with the 2023 season and came at the perfect time for Apple. Apple also participated in the deal that led to Messi's transfer to the MLS. The tech giant is reportedly offering the soccer superstar a portion of the revenue from all new MLS Season Pass subscriptions sold. MLS Season Pass comes with a cost of $14.99 per month, or $12.99 per month for existing AppleTV+ subscribers. There are also full season packages available. Other companies that could benefit from Messi\u2019s success at Inter Miami include Ares Management Corp (NYSE:ARES), which invested in the club, and MGO Global Inc (NASDAQ:MGOL), which managed the online Messi store.

                "title": "iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14: 6 Changes That Will Make The iPhone 15 A Notable Upgrade",
                "body": "Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 series is shaping up to be a considerable upgrade as it closes to its September 12 launch, alongside the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Unsurprisingly, the perennial debate of whether you should upgrade to the upcoming iPhone or buy last year's iPhone is also on the rise. If the iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 debate is confusing you, read on to find out more. What Happened: Apple is set to launch the iPhone 15 series this September, along with several other devices. However, the prime focus will remain on the iPhone 15, and this year, Apple seems to be all geared up to take on the competition. See Also: Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro Models Could Still Get 8GB RAM With A Performance Bump, But There\u2019s A Catch iPhone 15 rumors began early this year, starting in January \u2013 nine months before the launch of Apple's next-gen iPhones. From design changes to improvements in core features like camera and battery technology, the iPhone 15 series is shaping up to be a massive upgrade. This should also help you seal the iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 argument. 1. Titanium Body vs Steel Frame The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to borrow from the Apple Watch Ultra in terms of design \u2013 the frame that runs around the iPhone 15 Pro will now be made of titanium instead of steel. The titanium frame will have a brushed finish instead of the glossy finish that the iPhone 14 series have. 2. USB Type-C Port To Replace The Lightning Port One of the most significant changes this year will be the USB Type-C port, replacing the lightning port. Apple's switch to the more universal port is, reportedly, in response to European Union regulation, making it easier to find a charger since most other smartphones sold over the last few years have the same port.\u00a0 3. Stacked Battery Technology The iPhone 15 series is expected to be powered by up to 20% more dense batteries, helping them last longer than their predecessors. Apple is said to use stacked battery technology borrowed from electric vehicles. This will help Apple maintain the same size as the iPhone 14 models while increasing battery capacity by up to 20%. 4. Periscope Camera So You Can Zoom In Deeper The top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to receive a major camera upgrade this year \u2013 Apple is rumored to include a periscope camera in its flagship, significantly improving its zooming capabilities. Will the iPhone 15 Pro Max be the best camera phone of the year? Time will tell. 5. Programmable Action Button To Replace The Mute Switch The iPhone 15 series will borrow another feature from the Apple Watch Ultra \u2013 a programmable Action button. This will replace the iconic mute switch. Users will be able to program the button for different actions like toggling the flashlight, ring/silent or do not disturb modes, low power mode, and more. 6. Dynamic Island On All iPhone 15 Models Dynamic Island was a divisive feature at launch, but Apple and developers have since then demonstrated that it can be useful and look good while doing its job. Now, Apple is rumored to be bringing it to the non-Pro iPhone 15 models, too \u2013 the non-Pro iPhone 14 models featured a regular notch. Lastly, the conclusion: should you upgrade to the iPhone 15? Unlike in the past, where iPhones usually received iterative upgrades, the iPhone 15 series could pack quite a punch this year. From camera to design to battery life and more, Apple is rumored to focus on improving all the core aspects of a smartphone. On the Android side, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is a power-packed alternative, complete with a stylus and a huge stunning display. Given its flagship status, the iPhone 15 Pro Max will compete with the Galaxy S23 Ultra and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Pixel 8 Pro, which is expected to launch soon after the iPhone 15 series. However, if you want to jump from the iPhone 14 to the iPhone 15, you will want to wait out one more generation if your iPhone 14 still functions without any issues. While the upgrades are notable, the iPhone 14 series is still highly competitive and powerful enough in 2023.

Unsurprisingly, the perennial debate of whether you should upgrade to the upcoming iPhone or buy last year's iPhone is also on the rise. If the iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 debate is confusing you, read on to find out more. What Happened: Apple is set to launch the iPhone 15 series this September, along with several other devices. However, the prime focus will remain on the iPhone 15, and this year, Apple seems to be all geared up to take on the competition. See Also: Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro Models Could Still Get 8GB RAM With A Performance Bump, But There\u2019s A Catch iPhone 15 rumors began early this year, starting in January \u2013 nine months before the launch of Apple's next-gen iPhones. From design changes to improvements in core features like camera and battery technology, the iPhone 15 series is shaping up to be a massive upgrade. This should also help you seal the iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 argument. 1. Titanium Body vs Steel Frame The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to borrow from the Apple Watch Ultra in terms of design \u2013 the frame that runs around the iPhone 15 Pro will now be made of titanium instead of steel. The titanium frame will have a brushed finish instead of the glossy finish that the iPhone 14 series have. 2. USB Type-C Port To Replace The Lightning Port One of the most significant changes this year will be the USB Type-C port, replacing the lightning port. Apple's switch to the more universal port is, reportedly, in response to European Union regulation, making it easier to find a charger since most other smartphones sold over the last few years have the same port.\u00a0 3. Stacked Battery Technology The iPhone 15 series is expected to be powered by up to 20% more dense batteries, helping them last longer than their predecessors. Apple is said to use stacked battery technology borrowed from electric vehicles. This will help Apple maintain the same size as the iPhone 14 models while increasing battery capacity by up to 20%. 4. Periscope Camera So You Can Zoom In Deeper The top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to receive a major camera upgrade this year \u2013 Apple is rumored to include a periscope camera in its flagship, significantly improving its zooming capabilities. Will the iPhone 15 Pro Max be the best camera phone of the year? Time will tell. 5. Programmable Action Button To Replace The Mute Switch The iPhone 15 series will borrow another feature from the Apple Watch Ultra \u2013 a programmable Action button. This will replace the iconic mute switch. Users will be able to program the button for different actions like toggling the flashlight, ring/silent or do not disturb modes, low power mode, and more. 6. Dynamic Island On All iPhone 15 Models Dynamic Island was a divisive feature at launch, but Apple and developers have since then demonstrated that it can be useful and look good while doing its job. Now, Apple is rumored to be bringing it to the non-Pro iPhone 15 models, too \u2013 the non-Pro iPhone 14 models featured a regular notch. Lastly, the conclusion: should you upgrade to the iPhone 15? Unlike in the past, where iPhones usually received iterative upgrades, the iPhone 15 series could pack quite a punch this year. From camera to design to battery life and more, Apple is rumored to focus on improving all the core aspects of a smartphone. On the Android side, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is a power-packed alternative, complete with a stylus and a huge stunning display. Given its flagship status, the iPhone 15 Pro Max will compete with the Galaxy S23 Ultra and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Pixel 8 Pro, which is expected to launch soon after the iPhone 15 series. However, if you want to jump from the iPhone 14 to the iPhone 15, you will want to wait out one more generation if your iPhone 14 still functions without any issues. While the upgrades are notable, the iPhone 14 series is still highly competitive and powerful enough in 2023.

                "body": "Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) drivers can now reportedly ask Siri to unlock their vehicle doors, cool their cars or even start charging. What Happened: By updating to version 4.24.0 of Tesla\u2019s iOS app, users can execute commands by asking Siri on either their Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone or watch, Tesla North reported.  One can lock or unlock their vehicle, start or stop charging or even enable or disable sentry mode and dog mode, the report added.  This ease of doing certain actions was enabled via integration with Apple\u2019s Shortcuts app which allows for the completion of tasks with apps through a voice command to Siri. As per the report, drivers can now also precondition their vehicles or open the trunk, frunk, or charge port.  Why It Matters: Though third-party apps allowed users to use Siri to command their Tesla before, now it can be done without them, further automating both the Tesla and Apple experience. But Tesla is yet to have CarPlay on its cars.  However, there are rumors of AirPlay coming soon on Tesla cars and offering an alternative for streaming high-quality content to the vehicle's sound system. If successfully implemented in Tesla vehicles, AirPlay would enable drivers and passengers to wirelessly stream music, podcasts, and more from their iPhones directly to the car's sound system without the need for Bluetooth pairing.

                "title": "Elon Musk's Risky Twitter Rebranding Is Tanking X's Rank And Downloads In App Store And Play Store",
                "body": "Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter to X has had an unsurprising outcome \u2013 the social media app's ranking and downloads have tanked in Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play Store. What Happened: Musk's rebranding of Twitter to X is starting to look like a blunder, with the app's ranking and downloads plummeting on the two most popular app stores in the world, said Eric Benjamin Seufert, a media strategist who runs the Mobile Dev Memo platform. See Also: Grab The Top-Spec 16-inch MacBook Pro With M1 Max At A $1,100 Discount According to Seufert's data, X app ranks at a measly 51 on the App Store in the top free downloads category, while it is at 66th place in the Play Store. On the other hand, X clone Threads is at number 2 on the App Store and number 6 on the Play Store. This is despite Meta Platforms Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Threads losing nearly 75% of its daily active users in the US. \"My hypothesis is that, while the terminally-online are entirely aware of Twitter's rebrand to X, most consumers aren't, and their searches for \"Twitter\" on platform stores surface ads and genuine search results that are in no way redolent of Twitter,\" Seufert said. Seufert's data shows a dramatic drop in X's downloads on the App Store immediately after Musk made the rebranding announcement \u2013 it fell from the 24th rank to 64th as of August 15. The subsequent decision to kill and replace the beloved Twitter bird with an unrecognizable \u2018X' could have worsened matters. Why It's Important: Twitter became a household name worldwide in the nearly two decades of its existence, with \"Find me on Twitter\" and Twitter usernames with the handle \u2013 for example, @benzinga \u2013 becoming ubiquitous. However, Musk has made some very controversial decisions since taking over the ownership and management of the company. His decision to kill the Twitter brand and use a far more generic \u2018X' name could just be among the most damaging, going by Seufert's data.

                "body": "In another example of how risky it can be to download apps from unauthorized sources, a new study has revealed that thousands of Android app files are laden with malware capable of escaping detection by most threat detection tools. What Happened: A new study has found that thousands of Android Package (APK) files on the internet are riddled with advanced malware that is escaping detection by most of the available threat detection tools. See Also: Facebook\u2019s $725M Data Privacy Settlement: How To File A Claim, Eligibility, Payout Details And More According to cybersecurity research firm Zimperium, Android malware developers have taken the lead over threat detection tools, creating apps laden with malware that allow them to pass security checks using the available tools. The firm has found over 3,000 samples out there that are currently using these advanced algorithms to bypass security checks and wreak havoc on the compromised devices they are installed on. Of these, 71 apps could seamlessly integrate themselves into the operating system on user devices, fooling even the built-in security tools like Google's Play Protect scanner. Why Is It Important: While Android's open nature and the ability to sideload apps gives users the freedom to break free from the dependence on Google Play Store, it can also prove to be a double-edged sword in cases where APK files include malware that can avoid security checks. This has often caused plenty of headaches for Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google \u2013 reports of malware-ridden Android apps have been common yearly. On the other hand, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed-source approach and strict approval processes have proven to be relatively more successful in warding off these threats. However, with new European Union regulations requiring Apple to allow sideloading on iPhones and iPads, it remains to be seen whether Apple remains relatively shielded from malware. With phones being such an important part of our personal lives now, staying safe from malware has never been more critical.

                "body": "The highly anticipated debut of Apple's iPhone 15 series is garnering significant interest from investors and tech enthusiasts. Investors in the market are eagerly awaiting the product's release, recognizing its potential impact on its stock price. Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) success hinges on constant innovation and growth, making stagnation unacceptable, and this flagship product could prove to be another triumph for the company. Its sales have the potential to inspire confidence in investors and propel the stock to unprecedented heights in the market. Despite reaching record highs in July, the stock price then experienced an unexpected 11% drop. This decline is especially notable considering the stock was approaching the significant $200 resistance, which is a crucial psychological level for investors and proved to hold strong on this occasion. The stock's fall was amplified by dropping through its previous all-time high of $182. These fluctuations in the stock market hold significant meaning, reflecting changes in investor sentiment and market confidence. Apple investors faced a challenging period in mid-August. The stock experienced a three-day decline from August 15th to August 17th, causing understandable concern. However, there was some positive news to end the week. On Friday, the stock showed signs of improvement, closing up 0.28% and suggesting a potential shift in trajectory. When discussing August, it is impossible to ignore the significant 3% drop on August 4th due to the earnings announcement. This wasn't just a minor hiccup but a substantial movement that helped to push the stock price below its previous strong levels of support. The once reliable support levels now appeared to be overwhelmed by the downward pressure. However, amidst every low point, there is the potential for a high point. The positive end to last week presents an enticing opportunity. In order for Apple to reclaim its influential position in the stock market, there are a few specific goals to accomplish. First and foremost, the target is to surpass the significant barrier of $182.  Once that milestone is reached, the next objective is to break the current all-time high set on July 19th at $198. Despite recent market fluctuations, Apple's stock has still achieved an impressive 33% growth this year, showcasing the brand's enduring appeal and ability to excel in the market. After the closing bell on Friday, August 18, the stock closed at $174.49, trading up by 0.28%.",

                "title": "Market Clubhouse Morning Memo - August 21st, 2023 (Trade Strategy For SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, TSLA, And NVDA)",
                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, TSLA, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: The SPY (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0has experienced an upward gap overnight, showing resilience in the premarket as we approach Monday's session. It's currently hovering just shy of our pivotal 438.78 level. For bullish momentum, we're eyeing a solid reclaim of 438.78, with a subsequent target set at 439.66. If buyers maintain their grip above 438.78, we could see a push towards 440.34. The day's high target for bulls is pegged at 441.06. Conversely, if 438.78 isn't firmly reclaimed, bearish sentiment might challenge 438.29. Should sellers gain traction, a dip to 437.92 is anticipated. A significant breach here could lead to a descent towards 437.02. In the event of a pronounced bearish session, we might test 436.51, with the day's bear low set at 435.59. The Q's (NASDAQ:QQQ)\u00a0have shown an upward trajectory overnight, currently trading above our 360.08 benchmark. For a bullish continuation, we're looking for sustained activity above 360.08. If this level remains unchallenged, a climb towards 361.41 is likely. With sustained buying, our top bullish target for the day is 364.65. If trading struggles to maintain above 360.08, bearish forces might drive the price to 357.94. A breach here could lead to a further decline to 356.83, with a more pronounced descent targeting 355.93. In the event of a significant sell-off, our bearish target for the day is 355.32. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) has shown modest gains overnight, currently trading just above our 175.09 marker. On the upside, bulls are targeting 175.81, with the day's peak bullish target at 176.84. On the downside, if the momentum wanes below 175.09, we're looking at a potential descent to 174.05. Persistent selling could push the price to 173.24, with the day's bearish target set at 172.35. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently trading slightly below our 318.48 support level. Bulls aim to reclaim this mark, with an upward trajectory targeting 320.05. Strong buying could push towards the day's peak bullish target of 321.51. If 318.48 fails to hold, bearish momentum might drive the price to 316.04. In the event of pronounced selling, our bearish target for the day stands at 311.91. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) is trading around our 285.10 benchmark. Bulls aim to solidify this level as support, pushing towards 286.94. If momentum persists, 288.87 could come into play, with the day's peak bullish target set at 288.87. If 285.10 doesn't hold, we anticipate a bearish descent to 284.18, with a further decline targeting 283.08. A significant breach here could see 280.96, with our ultimate bearish target for the day at 276.76. Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) \u00a0is currently trading slightly below our 222.19 marker. Bulls aim for an upward trajectory, targeting 223.86. With sustained momentum, we could see 225.60, with the day's peak bullish target at 227.58. If 222.19 fails to hold, bearish forces might drive the price to 220.52. Intense selling could push towards 217.78, with the day's ultimate bearish target at 213.16. NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) has shown a pronounced upward gap in Monday's premarket session. Today, we're looking for the bulls to maintain 442.76 as a pivotal support level. If buyers dominate, we could see an ascent to 447.05. Persistent buying could push towards 450.04, with the day's high bull target set at 454.09. If 442.76 doesn't hold, we anticipate a bearish descent to 439.87. Intense selling could push towards 436.56, with our ultimate bearish target for the day at 432.36. Final Word: As we head into today's session, it's worth noting the absence of major US data releases. However, with NVIDIA set to report later this week, any significant movement in its price might influence other tech giants. As always, approach the market with caution and discipline.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is negative but expect the market to open higher.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\u00a0To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "title": "Is NVIDIA Overpriced? Cathie Wood's Ark Invest Highlights 3 Other AI Stocks",
                "body": "Over the last year, the conversation among investors and analysts has prominently centered on artificial intelligence. The topic of artificial intelligence is among the \"Big Ideas\" from Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest, but the ETF company says the days of Nvidia Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) reign as the go-to AI investment may be waning. What Happened: Shares of Nvidia are up over 200% year-to-date, as the company is seen as one of the major beneficiaries of growth in the artificial intelligence space. Wood and Ark Invest were previous investors in Nvidia, but sold their shares when they believed the\u00a0valuation got too high. Wood and Ark might be signaling Nvidia is hitting overvalued levels, calling for investors to look at small-cap companies instead. \u201cWe believe the days of relying solely on mega-cap companies for tech innovation are waning and an era of AI-centric small-cap companies is emerging. Find out where we see potential growth opportunities built on AI,\u201d Ark Invest tweeted Monday. In a new\u00a0report, Ark says that artificial intelligence could be a \u201clong-term growth driver more impactful than the internet.\u201d The research report says that mega-cap technology stocks saw a rally on the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence possibilities, but this might be the wrong move for traders to make. \u201cWe believe non-benchmark names are likely to accrue more value from AI over time.\u201d Related Link:\u00a0Generative AI On The Rise: 93% Of Companies To Boost Spending, US May Fall Behind Avoiding Mega Caps: The research report said that benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), respectively, saw rallies led by artificial intelligence-linked names. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Nvidia, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) made up 51% of the Nasdaq 100 as of June 30, according to the report. The report said\u00a0the six names also represented 68.8% of the rally for the Nasdaq 100 year-to-date through June 30. A chart from Ark shows\u00a0there is minimal overlap between the Invesco QQQ Trust and SPDR S&P 500 Global ETF with its two leading ETFs, the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) and Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW). Of the 504 holdings of the SPY, three are in the Ark Innovation ETF and five are in the Ark Next Generation ETF, representing 12.7% and 11.6% of assets, respectively. Ark also highlights that ARKK and ARKW only hold 0.5% and 1.6% of assets, respectively in the six large-cap names above, compared to 50.9% and 25.7% weightings for the SPY and QQQ. The performance of ARKK and ARKW through June has outpaced the performance of the SPY and QQQ, but the returns of the Ark ETFs trail the benchmarks when looking at three-year and five-year returns. \u201cFrom a portfolio management perspective, investing in the well-known benchmarks exposes investors to concentrate risk in a few well-known companies whose fortunes heavily influence their overall performance.\u201d Nvidia is trading at a price-to-sale multiple of 40.5x, Ark said.\u00a0 \u201cWhile we believe Nvidia is likely to remain a prime enabler and beneficiary of continued breakthroughs in AI, many other potential beneficiaries are not well understood, may sell at much lower valuations, and potentially could deliver significant revenue and earnings surprises on the high side of expectations.\u201d The report says that a company like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a good comparison to Nvidia. The company grew revenues exponentially in the 1990s, and the stock peaked at a price-to-sales ratio of 61x in 2000. Since that time, the stock has returned 1.4% on average annually, trailing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 benchmarks. Stocks to Watch: For years, one of Wood and Ark Invest's favorite stocks\u00a0has been electric vehicle leader Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Ark sees Tesla as one of the biggest beneficiaries of growth in AI, but also points to its valuation. Tesla trades at 9.6x time sales. \u201c(Tesla) is the largest AI exposure across our strategies given the $8-$10 trillion revenue opportunity and SaaS-like margins,\u201d the research report said. One of Ark\u2019s favorite AI related stocks is UiPath Inc (NYSE:PATH), a software and automation company. \u201cOur research suggests that other companies in this space rely too heavily on API\u2019s that are far-removed from natural human behavior and decision making. UiPath\u2019s emphasis on low-code no-code interfaces emphasizes flexibility, scalability and ease.\u201d UiPath is the fifth-largest holding in ARKK and eighth-largest holding in ARKW, representing 5.9% and 4.8% of assets, respectively. UiPath is also a top 10 holding in the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF), Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) and Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX). Another stock named in the report is Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO), a cloud-based communications platform-as-a-service company. \u201cIn our view, Twilio is building the leading customer communication platform including core messaging APIs and a suite of software products.\u201d Ark said Twilio could be best positioned to \u201cintroduce artificial intelligence into customer communication channels.\u201d \u201cAs budgets normalize, we believe Twilio should benefit significantly from the AI opportunity.\u201d Twilio is the ninth-largest holding of the Ark Innovation ETF. The price-to-sales ratios for PATH and TWLO are 8.3x and 2.9x respectively, as listed in the research report. Outside of public companies, Ark also highlighted its Ark Venture Fund, which holds investments in several notable privately held artificial intelligence companies including Replit, MosaicML, and Anthropic.

                "title": "Value Stocks Outshine Growth Amidst Rising Treasury Yields: Key Sectors and Stocks Analyzed",
                "body": "In recent weeks, value stocks have outperformed growth counterparts, proving to be a hedge against the market\u2019s downturn. The Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VTV) has beaten the Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VUG) by 5% during the past month. The momentum shift comes as investors recalibrate their strategies amidst fluctuating market dynamics. Growth equities, which are more sensitive to risk aversion and interest rates, have been hit more by the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields.  The combination of hawkish comments from the Fed, an acceleration of inflation in July, and higher-than-expected Treasury issuances this month has pushed up the costs of U.S. government debt to a level not seen since November 2007. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is now at 4.34%. Investors and analysts commonly utilize the 10-year Treasury yield as a gauge to discount the value of future cash flows for stocks. Higher Treasury yields negatively affect the value of those future cash flows, and vice versa, exerting downward pressure on growth stocks.

Its influence is prominently felt in the VTV portfolio, comprising over 7%, while in the VUG portfolio, it holds a modest 1.2% weight.  On the flip side, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) faced a setback, plummeting by 5% over the past month. It\u2019s joined in this performance dip by the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE). Technology stocks cast a significant weight, exceeding 40%, in the Vanguard Growth ETF, but screen a more subdued presence of 9.4% within the Vanguard Value ETF. Now, let\u2019s delve into the stocks driving this trend. In the realm of the Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF, the most noteworthy positive contribution during the recent month comes from Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM), carrying a substantial 2.5% weight. In the same period, Marathon Oil Corp. (NYSE:MRO) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) stand out with the most substantial returns, both up by 13%.  However, the value spectrum witnessed its own share of challenges. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), and JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) grappled with notable declines, recording 9.7%, 5.8%, and 4.3% drops, respectively. Turning to the Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF, the past month\u2019s primary boost came from Eli Lilly & Company (NYSE:LLY), showing an impressive 19% surge. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also shone with a 5.9% uptick, though its influence within the portfolio is marked at 6.4%. On the flip side, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) faced a formidable challenge, bearing the weight of a 13% decrease, followed by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a 12% weight and a 7.1% drop. Among the growth stocks, ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:ZI) took the title of the poorest performer in the past month, down by 35%.

In recent discussions, Son expressed confidence in Arm\u2019s potential contribution to AI, Reuters reports.\u00a0 Arm, as Son detailed in June, serves as a nexus for AI-related firms, and an impressive \u201c85% of SoftBank Group assets are AI-linked businesses abroad.\u201d Reportedly, Arm eyed a valuation of\u00a0$60 billion - $70 billion\u00a0in an IPO raising $8 billion - $10 billion. The target could be lower since SoftBank has decided to hold onto more of the company after buying Vision Fund\u2019s\u00a0stake. Potential investors will scrutinize how the U.K. chip designer plans to diversify beyond its mobile-chip designs, which\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) and\u00a0Amazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) leveraged. The enthusiastic CEO shared that he\u2019s been intensely collaborating with AI-driven ChatGPT, conceiving hundreds of innovations, which he believes can materialize via Arm.\u00a0 However, Son\u2019s claims have been sparse on specifics. Investors are looking for this forthcoming filing to shed light on SoftBank\u2019s AI game plan and determine if Arm\u2019s value aligns with, or perhaps exceeds, a pre-IPO estimate of $64 billion. While Son\u2019s optimism for Arm has been a recurrent theme, some analysts remain skeptical. Despite his previous assertions that the Internet of Things (IoT) would revolutionize the world, with Arm-powered chips taking the lead, IoT currently comprises a minor segment of Arm\u2019s earnings.\u00a0 Moreover, analysts like Kirk Boodry stress that Arm isn\u2019t at the AI boom\u2019s heart but exists more on its periphery. In comparison, semiconductor giant\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) has emerged as the prime beneficiary of the AI surge. Their high-end chips are the backbone for data centers operating large language models like ChatGPT.\u00a0 Arm, though, has a window of opportunity here. As Nvidia\u2019s chips demand energy-efficient CPUs, a domain where Arm excels, there\u2019s potential for collaboration. Still, Nvidia faces stiff competition, and not all its GPUs must incorporate an Arm CPU. Rolf Bulk of New Street Research points out that Arm\u2019s prospects may be rooted in AI and machine learning pivoting from centralized cloud servers to user-end devices like phones or household gadgets.\u00a0 These gadgets demand a specific intellectual property, a realm where Arm has previously showcased prowess. Arm\u2019s debut could spur dozens of startups like online grocery delivery company\u00a0Instacart Inc\u00a0and a breather for fee-starved investment bankers. There are at least 28 banks signed onto Arm\u2019s IPO. Disclaimer:\u00a0This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

                "body": "We first saw the mega cap technology names rotate lower, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) breaking down after clear bearish divergences.\u00a0 We now have almost all of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d growth stocks breaking down through their 50-day moving averages, joining about 55% of the S&P 500 members in doing so.\u00a0 Is this really the time to be bullish?\u00a0Well, yes and no, depending on your time frame.\u00a0My base case is for further downside in August into September, setting the benchmarks up for a nice rally in the fourth quarter.\u00a0But the essence of what I call \u201cprobabilistic analysis,\u201d of which I\u2019m a big proponent, is to force yourself to consider alternatives and think through various scenarios. I feel that investors are sometimes caught on the wrong side of the markets not because of a lack of conviction but because of a lack of imagination.\u00a0If we can think through different potential scenarios now, then we should be much better prepared when something unusual happens next! I'm super excited for our next free webcast,\u00a0THE GREAT ROTATION OF 2023. We'll talk seasonal tendencies, sector rotation, breadth dynamics, and leadership shifts with all the charts. If you're struggling to keep up with leadership shifts and competing narratives, let us help you cut through noise and focus on the message of the markets. We're going live on\u00a0Tuesday, August 22nd at 1:00pm ET. Sign up for this free webcast right\u00a0HERE! This also gives me another chance to post something completely opposite to Tom \u201cThe Bull\u201d Bowley, which is always a pleasure.\u00a0To be clear, his article this week makes some excellent points on sentiment shifts suggesting optimism here.\u00a0But let\u2019s get back to stretching our thinking with a bearish alternative or two. Today I\u2019ll briefly break down the current conditions in terms of price and breadth indicators.\u00a0We\u2019ll then review some signals that could confirm further downside potential and what we\u2019d need to see to turn away from a bearish thesis.\u00a0 When in doubt, follow the trend in the markets.\u00a0And the trend is currently down.\u00a0Well, it actually depends on your time frame.\u00a0Our Market Trend Model is bearish on the short-term but still bullish on the medium-term and long-term.  I tend to use the medium-term model as a primary indicator of \u201crisk on\u201d or \u201crisk off\u201d conditions, so this would suggest that even though we\u2019ve seen short-term weakness, the primary trend is still higher. A chart of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, which I use as a New Dow Theory indicator inspired by Charles Dow\u2019s original work, shows that the S&P 500 index is still above a trendline using closing prices from October 2022 and March 2023.  Here\u2019s the problem.\u00a0Note how the growth-dominated Nasdaq 100 ETF has already broken down through a similar trendline?\u00a0An argument could be made that the current selloff is being driven by growth stocks, but could eventually be magnified when everything else starts to rotate lower.\u00a0That leads me to market breadth indicators, and we\u2019ll focus on the 50-day moving average. About four weeks ago, 90% of the S&P 500 members were above their 50-day moving average.\u00a0Now that reading is closer to 35%.  Even more concerning is the panel just above, which shows the percent of S&P 500 stocks above their 200-day moving average.\u00a0Generally speaking, bulls should want this indicator to remain above 50%, because waterfall declines tend to happen when more than half of the S&P 500 members are unable to hold this key long-term barometer. The last three times that this indicator dipped below 50%, it ended up being a buyable dip.\u00a0Signals in May 2023, March 2023, and December 2022 were all higher lows.\u00a0But look further to the left and you can see that a breakdown like this has also been the beginning of much larger declines in terms of price and time.\u00a0 So while there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s a brief pullback, there\u2019s also a chance that it\u2019s much worse from here. I would say that as long as a pullback here stalls out above SPX 4200, then you have to consider this a tactical pullback within a primary uptrend.\u00a0This would mean that the S&P 500 remains above the 38.2% Fibonacci support level, and also important trendline support based on the October 2022 and March 2023 levels.  The 200-day moving average will likely be not too far below as well, in the 4150-4200 range depending on how quickly this decline would progress.\u00a0So we have a confluence of support, with multiple indicators all keying in on the same level. But what if the S&P would fail to find support at 4200?\u00a0 I was taught that all large losses begin as small losses.\u00a0If we\u2019re unable to hold 4200, then the chances of a waterfall decline increase in a big way.\u00a0In that scenario, mega cap growth names would have moved much lower in August, and an absence of buyers would lead to additional selling as investors run for the exits. We\u2019ve already seen bearish momentum divergences, initial breakdowns of short-term moving averages, and meaningful declines in breadth indicators.\u00a0All that\u2019s left is a fail to hold key support.\u00a0Then be prepared for further downside potential. To be clear, I hope this bearish scenario does not play out.\u00a0I believe 4200 will hold, and the seasonal studies would suggest that the fourth quarter will likely be stronger than a generally weak third quarter.\u00a0So what would confirm to me that the bear thesis is no longer playing out as outlined above? In the words of legendary technical analyst Paul Montgomery, \u201cThe most bullish thing the market can do is go up.\u201d\u00a0Quite simply, prices of risk assets would have to stop going down and start going up again. That would mean momentum indicators like RSI would become oversold but then turn higher.\u00a0Perhaps we would see some bullish momentum divergences as stocks approach key moving average resistance, providing a glimmer of hope in dark times. The weekly MACD, which is dangerously close to a major sell signal, would need to turn back higher.\u00a0Look back in 2012 and 2013 for examples of initial sell signals that just never really materialized.\u00a0Once the MACD indicator turned back higher, it often confirmed a resumption of the primary uptrend.  Whether you are bullish or bearish or decidedly undecided, it\u2019s important to consider all the possible future paths for stocks.\u00a0Think about how your portfolio would weather certain conditions, how you would manage positions and minimize risk if the market moves against you, and how you would recognize the changing character of the markets.

                "body": "Apple Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming\u00a0iPhone 15 Pro Max\u00a0launch could face significant delays, potentially pushing the\u00a0release date to October\u00a0due to a reported supply chain issue involving\u00a0Sony Group Corp. (NYSE:SONY).\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0The primary culprit behind this potential delay is the image sensor required for the iPhone 15 Pro Max\u2019s periscope camera \u2014 exclusive to the upcoming lineup\u2019s flagship model, making it indispensable for the smartphone\u2019s advanced camera capabilities. Sony, a key supplier for Apple, is struggling to provide a sufficient number of these specialized sensors in time for the anticipated September launch,\u00a0reported\u00a09To5Mac, citing an unnamed major equity analyst.\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0iPhone 15 Could Help Apple Overtake Samsung To Become World\u2019s Top Smartphone Maker For The First Time This is not the first time\u00a0concerns about potential delays\u00a0in Apple\u2019s product release schedule have been raised. Previous reports have also hinted at possible delays for various models in the iPhone 15 lineup. However, this is the first time Sony\u2019s role in the supply chain crunch has been explicitly cited. Earlier, a report from\u00a0Bank of America\u00a0indicated a potential delay of the iPhone 15 until October, although it didn\u2019t specify the model. Analyst\u00a0Jeff Pu, a tech analyst at Hong Kong-based investment firm\u00a0Haitong International Securities, identified the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus as likely candidates for the delayed release. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0The iPhone 15 series, poised to deliver several upgrades such as slimmer bezels, camera improvements, the introduction of an Action Button, and various design and hardware upgrades, is reportedly scheduled for a grand unveiling on Sept. 12. Moreover, rumors suggest a\u00a0potential price increase of $100\u00a0for the U.S. iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max variants. According to Mark Gurman, this price hike may extend to all four models, although to varying extents, outside of the U.S.\u00a0 Given the expected upgrades in design and hardware for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, this $100 adjustment\u00a0could be seen as justifiable.

They want to know what new features the iPhone 15 will bring that the current iPhone 14 doesn\u2019t. They consider if these added features are worth the wait.

See Also:\u00a0How Much Will iPhone 15 Pro Cost? At Least $100 More Than Current Models, New Report Hints iPhone 14 photos, as shared by Apple at the time of the release. Apple unveiled its current iPhone series on September 14, 2022. The lineup includes the regular iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus (replacing the mini version), iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\u00a0 While the basic iPhone 14 models\u00a0have minimal updates\u00a0from their predecessors, the high-end series boasts significant improvements. It features a new A16 Bionic chipset, satellite connectivity for emergency SOS service, and a 48-megapixel Camera System.\u00a0 One exciting feature exclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro series is Dynamic Island, which delivers alerts and live activities at the top of the display. The battery life is also impressive, with the iPhone 14 Pro Max offering a runtime of 13 hours and 39 minutes during continuous web surfing over 5G at 150 nits of screen brightness.\u00a0 The iPhone 14 Pro, with its smaller 3,200 mAh battery inside a smaller 6.1-inch phone, lasted for 10 hours and 13 minutes,\u00a0according\u00a0to Tom\u2019s Guide.\u00a0 What to expect from the iPhone 15? Photo by\u00a0Martin Sanchez\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash The iPhone 15 series is expected to bring some exciting new features and upgrades. One major change could be the introduction of\u00a0a periscope lens, offering a 6X optical zoom on the iPhone 15 Pro Max. This upgrade would put Apple\u2019s zoom capabilities on par with those of Samsung phones. However, rumors suggest the feature will only be available on the Pro Max models, excluding the regular iPhone 15 Pro.\u00a0 The EU mandate to\u00a0switch from Lightning to USB-C\u00a0port is also expected to be fulfilled in the iPhone 15 series, bringing faster charging and possibly faster transfer speeds. Currently, Apple\u2019s smartphones come with the proprietary Lightning port, introduced in September 2012.\u00a0 It was also reported that the Cupertino, California-based tech giant plans to introduce the\u00a0Dynamic Island feature, previously exclusive to Pro models, to non-Pro models this September.\u00a0 Rumors also suggest that the iPhone 15 Pro will be powered by the world\u2019s first\u00a03nm-based A17 Bionic chip, offering even better performance than the 4nm A16 Bionic. Early leaked benchmark scores seem to support these claims. Additionally, the A17 Bionic chip is said to be 35% more power-efficient, which means better battery life for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\u00a0 The design of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max is also expected to see some changes, with rounded edges and a\u00a0possible titanium alloy body\u00a0that\u2019s lighter and stronger than previous models.\u00a0 For those considering purchasing an iPhone 14 Pro, it\u2019s worth noting that Apple typically introduces a main chassis design change once every three years. With the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, this could mean a more comfortable,\u00a0curved edge and thinner display bezels.\u00a0 Analysts predict the iPhone 15 series will be released in September 2023, with the Pro models expected to be relatively expensive. Over the weekend, tech analyst\u00a0Jeff Pu\u00a0at Hong Kong-based investment firm\u00a0Haitong International Securities\u00a0reiterated that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are expected to feature a rear camera with a three-stacked sensor.\u00a0 He also speculated that the stacked sensor might\u00a0encounter yield problems\u00a0that could delay production. However, it\u2019s important to remember that these are just predictions, and the actual release date and price could differ.\u00a0 If you\u2019re considering waiting for the iPhone 15, keep in mind that iPhone 14 prices may drop after the iPhone 15 is released. While Apple is known for retaining prices, exceptions can occur. If Apple drops the prices, it could be a good opportunity to save money on a new iPhone, but you\u2019ll have to wait for at least four months.\u00a0 The iPhone 15 series will bring significant upgrades, including support for Dynamic Island on all devices, switching to USB Type-C, and possibly an overhauled design and improved zoom.\u00a0 Waiting for the new models could save buyers from potential regret, as the package is likely to be significantly better than the current models. However, if you can\u2019t wait and need to upgrade now, it\u2019s best to avoid the non-Pro iPhone 14 models and choose the iPhone 13, iPhone 14 Pro, or iPhone 14 Pro Max instead.\u00a0 If you\u2019re using an iPhone 12 or any smartphone that\u2019s at least three years old, upgrading to the iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max should suffice. But if you\u2019re undecided and can wait a few more months, waiting until the iPhone 15 release could be wise.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) opened higher in overnight trading and has displayed remarkable momentum in the premarket for Tuesday. Currently, it hovers just below the pivotal mark of 442.04. For bullish traders, a sustained break and hold above 442.04 will be vital. With strong buying momentum, we may see an upward push towards 442.61, followed by 443.42 and 443.90. Today's optimal bullish outcome targets 445.08. Conversely, if SPY can't solidify above 442.04, bearish pressures might test the 441.62 region. A confirmed presence of sellers could then drive prices towards 441.06. A significant downward move might aim for 440.34, with an eventual bearish objective of 438.78 if selling persists. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) kicked off Tuesday's overnight and premarket trade with an upward gap and currently oscillate around the pivotal 366.69 level. Bullish sentiment will thrive if 366.69 remains intact as support, potentially aiming for 367.52 and later 368.57. The day's peak bullish target stands at 369.39. Should 366.69 fail to hold, bearish momentum may aim for 366.15 and 365.59. Persistent sellers could drag prices to 364.65 and possibly 363.23. In an intensified sell-off scenario, 361.41 becomes a key focus, with the day's most bearish target at 360.08. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) showcased an overnight upward gap, positioning itself just above the 176.84 benchmark. On the upside, 177.31 emerges as the initial point of interest. Robust buying could propel prices towards a daily peak of 178.18. Should prices slide below 176.84, bears might aim for 176.29. Persistent selling may then target 175.81, with a deeper bearish perspective eyeing 175.09. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently trading slightly beneath the 326.05 support. Bulls would aim to secure and maintain this level, potentially catalyzing an upward move targeting 328.52 and possibly 331.24. However, if 326.05 remains elusive, bearish forces might eye 324.81. A stronger downward pull could target 323.17 and possibly 321.51. The day's most bearish perspective for Microsoft stands at 320.05. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) trades beneath the pivotal 293.91 level. Bulls aim to regain this level, setting sights on 295.97 and potentially 297.33. With robust buying, the daily target peaks at 300.23. Conversely, if 293.91 remains out of reach, bears might target 291.18. Deeper selling could eye 288.87 and possibly 286.94. An intensified bearish scenario has 285.10 as the prime objective. NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) opened significantly higher this Tuesday premarket. The key for bulls today is to secure 478.67. A bullish dominance could aim for 482, and with sustained buying, targets of 485.00 and 490.00 become viable. If 478.67 crumbles, bearish pressures could target 473.81. A continued sell-off might drive prices towards 470.17, with the day's deep bearish goal at 464.95. Final Word: A few Fed speakers and vital data releases are on today's docket. The anticipation around NVIDIA's post-market earnings report tomorrow is making a case for bullish enthusiasm, especially within the mega cap tech giants.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is positive but can quickly turn negative.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "body": "Retail traders, the growing group of non professional investors who buy and sell stocks hoping to sell at a higher price than they bought, seem to have forgotten a very basic and initial rule of investing: Buy and Hold. Before you say to yourself, \"I've been holding Telsa Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock for 8-months!\" The average holding period for a stock in the U.S. is just 10 months, down from 5 years back in the 1970s, according to data from eToro. Moreover, without a buy-and-hold strategy, you might be overlooking a highly profitable mode of income. It\u2019s worth noting that esteemed hedge fund managers, such as Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio, are certainly not overlooking it. This isn\u2019t about volatile short squeezes or options trading; it\u2019s about the reliable and steady dividends. Here's some anecdotal evidence that should wake you up to how much you may be missing out on: year to date, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has handed over $645,350,303.61 to Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) solely in dividends. There are some 3,460 active hedge funds in the U.S. as of this year, many of which are lapping up fee-free quarterly dividend payments in the millions.

Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds with $124 billion in assets under management (AUM), got paid nearly $51 million in dividends year-to-date just from its top-5 holdings: iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:IEMG)iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV)Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)PepsiCo, Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital, with $10.8 billion AUM as of the second quarter, was paid more than $14.3 million in dividends over the course of the second quarter with just three stocks: Restaurant Brands International Inc (NYSE:QSR)Lowe\u2019s Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW)Hilton Hotels Corporation Common Stock (NYSE:HLT) David Tepper's Appaloosa Management, with $5.39 billion AUM as of the second quarter, enjoyed nearly $4.1 million in dividend payments from just four companies: Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM)FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX)Apple Inc Even the more contrarian hedge funds like Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management collected $164,835.25 in dividend payments from just a few stocks over the second quarter: Star Bulk Carriers Corp (NASDAQ:SBLK)Safe Bulkers Inc (NYSE:SB)Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG)CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS)While retail traders juggle the adrenaline rush of short-term plays, institutional giants are quietly reaping the benefits of time-tested wisdom: compound interest through dividends. As the modern trading ecosystem becomes even more rapid-paced, it\u2019s worth revisiting the age-old strategy of Buy and Hold. Because, at the end of the day, quick gains pale in comparison to the steady flow of dividends that the stalwarts of the industry are banking on.Read next: Johnson & Johnson Investors Pounce On Oversubscribed Kenvue Deal, How You Can Still Earn $500 A Month The image was created using artificial intelligence with MidJourney.",

                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) firmed up its foothold in the financial services arena with the launch of the Apple Card four years ago. The company had previously marked a foray into the sector with Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, launched in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Apple Card, a credit card issued by\u00a0Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), debuted in the U.S. on Aug. 20, 2019, exclusively for U.S. consumers.\u00a0 Linked to Apple Pay, it offers features like no fees, lower interest rates, and cash back on purchases. Integrated into the Wallet app and optimized for iPhone and iPad, users can set it as their default card for convenient in-store and online Apple product purchases via Apple Pay. While it functions like a traditional card, the titanium physical version covers non-Apple Pay transactions. In April, Apple introduced a high-yield savings account tied to the Apple Card, amassing over $10 billion in deposits by August. The Apple Card contributes to Apple\u2019s Services business, a pivotal revenue generator. The Services segment achieved record revenue in the recent June quarter results, boosting profitability with its higher margins. However, Goldman Sachs\u2019 \u201cPlatform Solutions,\u201d including Apple Card, saw a net loss of $667 million in the same quarter, largely due to increased credit loss provisions and operational expenses. Rumors of Goldman exiting the partnership due to its unattractive returns began doing the rounds earlier this year, although nothing has been confirmed officially yet. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock Apple\u2019s push deeper into the financial services industry is apparently due to its desire to capitalize on the rapidly evolving banking industry, which is bolstered by the integration of technology for improving user experience. Hypothetical Returns From Investing In Apple: If an investor had put in $1,000 in Apple on Aug. 20, 2019, when the Apple Card was launched, he would have 19.6 shares. The stock ended the day at a split-adjusted price of $51.15. The same 19.6 shares would be worth $3,465 (based on Tuesday's closing price of $177.23). The investment would have fetched a return of roughly 247% over a four-year period. In comparison, the broader S&P 500 Index generated a return of 51.3% and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, added 99.3%. Apple ended Tuesday's session at $177.23, up 0.79%, according to Benzinga Pro data. The stock is up about 37% year-to-date.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is known for its inclination towards innovation while restricting user and third-party customizations. This seems to be gradually changing in the future, at least for the Apple Watch, if the latest patent filing is to be believed. What Happened: Apple has filed a patent for its wearable that aims to let your Apple Watch\u2019s face adapt to the color of external objects like clothing, watch bands, and perhaps even your car. Apple Insider first spotted the patent. See Also: Grab The Top-Spec 16-inch MacBook Pro With M1 Max At A $1,100 Discount As described in a patent named \u201cElectronic Devices With Color Sampling Sensors,\u201d Apple has proposed a mechanism where the Watch\u2019s face color can be changed to match any external object. Here\u2019s how it could work: Until Apple Watch Series 8 and Watch Ultra, users can modify certain color elements on their Apple Watch; this technology would push the boundaries by allowing the entire face to match any object\u2019s palette. However, users would still be working within a predetermined color set. The patent document also explains the technicalities of this feature. The Watch might emit red, green, and blue light sequences, which the sensor would then use to detect the reflected light from the external object to determine its color. Interestingly, Apple has given different treatment algorithms for watch bands and other items. For bands, the colors might be picked from a preset list, while for clothing, it could recognize any color within a defined gamut. Why Is It Important: For nearly a decade, Apple enthusiasts and third-party developers have asked for the ability to customize Apple Watch faces. But Apple did not listen to the demands and kept them away from the freedom to design their watch faces from scratch. With this patent, Apple could take baby steps toward improving design customization in a unique direction. Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

                "title": "Bids For Sealed iPhone From 2007 Skyrocket To $45,000, Fetching 75x Its Original Price",
                "body": "Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) first-generation iPhone in a sealed box is a rare collector's item, and one such piece has now dropped at an auction, attracting bids of nearly $45,000. What Happened: The first-generation iPhone is a hot commodity amongst collectors, besides letters from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Now, one such iPhone has gone on auction, attracting bids worth $44,799 so far, which is nearly 75 times its original price. See Also: If You Invested $1,000 In Apple Stock When Apple Card Was Launched 4 Years Ago, Here\u2019s How Much You\u2019d Have Now The original iPhone on auction at RR Auction comes in an 8GB avatar. Launched in 2007, the iPhone revolutionized the smartphone industry and had a deciding impact on Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Android operating system. While Google had initially geared Android to compete with BlackBerry, the iPhone launch forced it to pivot to a touch-based user interface. Apple Is A Collector's Favorite: Rare Apple memorabilia are one of the favorite items of collectors. For instance, a 1983 letter from Steve Jobs with his signature fetched its owner a record $480,000. Another rare original iPhone with 4GB capacity fetched $190,000 in an auction, showing that people are highly interested in these items. What worked for the 4GB iPhone was that it had extremely limited production runs, making it an extremely rare item. The original Apple founding contract fetched $1.59 million in 2011, establishing Apple as a corporate entity in 1976. This was more than ten times the initial estimates of $150,000. If you have an Apple product or a letter from Steve Jobs, you might just want to hold onto it and keep it safe, it could be a huge payday at some point.

                "body": "This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is keen on ramping up its domestic component production in India. This revelation came to light during a recent t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate between Apple\u2019s top brass and India\u2019s finance ministry officials. What Happened?\u00a0Diving into the details, a government insider told MoneyControl that, \u201cApple\u2019s July presentation was all about their intent. They\u2019re not just looking to assemble iPhones here; they\u2019re keen on boosting the domestic component scene.\u201d The dialogue wasn\u2019t just about Apple\u2019s ambitions but also revolved around understanding the supply chain better and the broader growth trajectory of India\u2019s smartphone manufacturing sector. However, the government\u2019s stance on tax incentives still seems to be a firm no.

A quick flashback:\u00a0Apple began its Indian iPhone manufacturing journey in 2017. Fast forward to now, and they\u2019ve got a robust assembly line in place, thanks to partnerships with big names like\u00a0Foxconn and Wistron. And if you\u2019ve been around Mumbai or Delhi lately, you might\u2019ve spotted Apple\u2019s shiny new stores, marking another milestone in its India journey.

                "title": "Market Clubhouse Morning Memo - August 23rd, 2023 (Trade Strategy For SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, And NVDA)",
                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: The SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY)\u00a0experienced a gap up in the overnight session, then gave back some of those gains, and is currently hovering around our pivotal level of 438.78. Bulls will be eyeing 438.78 to establish as a foundational support. If buyers rally, the bulls might set their sights on 439.66, with sustained buying possibly pushing to 440.34. Our bullish apex for the day is set at 441.06. Conversely, if 438.78 isn\u2019t secured and maintained as support, the market could drift down to 438.29. Continued offloading might push the bears to challenge the 437.92 level. A significant breakdown that might see the bears guiding the price to a deeper support level at 437.92. With more selling, the price could test 436.51. The day\u2019s ultimate bearish target is eyed at 435.59. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) experienced an initial rise overnight but later retraced their steps, currently gravitating around 363.23. For bullish momentum, sustained buying above 363.23 is essential. If this level stands firm, the next bullish checkpoint could be 364.65, with potential extensions to 365.59 and 366.15. The day\u2019s bullish high for the Q's is projected at 366.69. However, if 363.23 proves fragile, anticipate the bears steering the price sharply lower, possibly to 362.13. A breach here might prompt the bears to test the resilience of 361.41. A further decline could put the day's bearish base at 360.08. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u00a0experienced an uptick during the overnight session, but a chunk of those gains eroded. It's now transacting slightly above 177.31. On the upside, 178.18 stands as a potential bolster. Strong buying past 178.18 could lead to the bulls charging towards a daily high at 178.61. On the flip side, any fragility under 177.31 might redirect price actions to 176.84 for a support test. Persistent bearishness could drive prices to 176.29, with the possibility of a deeper bearish run targeting 175.81 for the day. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is currently steering slightly above the support line of 323.17. Bulls will aim to secure 324.81 as a strong base. A rally above this crucial level might see the trajectory aiming for 326.05, with a bullish culmination potentially reaching 328.52. However, if 323.17 wavers as a support, anticipate bearish movements testing the 321.51 zone. Breaching this might open up space for a further descent towards 320.05. If selling persists, the day\u2019s bearish low target is eyed at 318.48. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0appears to be finding a floor at 286.94. Bullish sentiments will hinge on this level for support, aiming for an ascent towards 288.87. Securing this level might catalyze a move towards 291.18. Spirited buying could propel the day's peak to 293.91. Should 286.94 fail to hold, bearish momentum might press prices down to 285.10. A continued selloff might push the bears to a deeper level at 284.18, with extended bearish pressures possibly reaching the day's lows at 280.96. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), with its impending earnings announcement, is set to exhibit volatility. The bulls will aim to solidify 458.20 as a pivotal support. Strong buying might elevate prices to successive levels at 461.49 and 464.95, with a bullish surge potentially touching 470.17. An enthusiastic buying rally might climax at 473.81. Conversely, if 458.20 proves unstable, expect the bears to direct the narrative towards 454.09. Intensified selling could challenge the 450.04 mark, with the day's bearish floor potentially at 447.05. Final Word: Today's focus is split between the PMI data release and NVIDIA's post-market earnings announcement. Anticipate potential swings in mega cap tech stocks.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is positive but can quickly turn negative.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0 The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0 Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "title": "Anticipating Reversals By Understanding Institutional Positioning",
                "body": "As the rally off the October 2022 lows raged on through the summer of 2023, I began to see bearish positioning in QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) and growth stocks that suggested the rally would soon be ending.\u00a0In this article I will walk you through how I used Volumeleaders.com to detect changes to institutional positioning which preceded a trend reversal. Institutions trade with size and leave footprints wherever they go.\u00a0Within these footprints lies valuable information.\u00a0Volumeleaders.com captures these large trades and then calculates several custom metrics to help subscribers understand more about their size, rarity, and uniqueness.\u00a0 Among these metrics are trade rankings, which I\u2019ll be discussing in this article.\u00a0 Any time a large trade is logged by volumeleaders.com, it\u2019s ranked by dollars against all other trades of the same ticker going back 20 years.\u00a0 Any trade ranked in the top-100 is annotated as such.\u00a0 When these ranked trades arrive, they tell us institutions are unusually active and positioning themselves with enough size and conviction that we can expect a meaningful move.\u00a0What constitutions \u2018large\u2019 is relative to each ticker as each behaves uniquely.\u00a0 But the one thing they all have in common is that large trades tend to arrive at or near relative highs and lows and precede large magnitude moves.\u00a0 If we can detect and infer the intent behind those large trades, we can position ourselves accordingly.\u00a0 In each of the charts below, trade rank is displayed on the bubble representing each trade.\u00a0 One of the most common and reliable patterns observed when watching institutions trade is that of leveraged ETFs. Typically, the pattern unfolds like this: One reason for this behavior is that institutions trade leveraged ETFs only during the sharpest moves in either direction.\u00a0This is due to the inherent decay and risk associated with holding leveraged ETFs for longer periods of time.\u00a0Institutions trade in very large sizes and can\u2019t get their orders filled at the absolute highs and lows of a given move because there isn\u2019t sufficiently liquidity at the edges.\u00a0But they can get filled just above the lows and below the highs.\u00a0That\u2019s the zone in which they typically operate.\u00a0 However, in this case we got a rare gift because both the bull ETF and the bear ETF arrived with unusual size at the same time suggesting that institutions were repositioning themselves from long to short.\u00a0There was no new nominal high in TQQQ nor a nominal low in SQQQ.\u00a0 Price immediately reversed and a new downward trend began in QQQ.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Below are charts from July 18, 2023, showing TQQQ\u00a0(NASDAQ:TQQQ)\u00a0printing a disproportionately large trade near relative highs suggesting longs were closed and SQQQ\u00a0(NASDAQ:SQQQ) printing a disproportionately large trade near relative lows suggesting shorts were opened.\u00a0   QQQ is the underlying ETF upon which TQQQ and SQQQ are based.\u00a0Two weeks after the disproportionately large trades arrived in leveraged ETFs, price had made a lower high.\u00a0That\u2019s when the 2nd largest QQQ trade since inception printed.\u00a0The timing and location of this trade suggested institutions had initiated a large short position. Institutions buy low and sell high.\u00a0Probability favors a large position arriving after a 10-month rally to be bearish in nature.\u00a0Institutions don't typically deploy capital of this size at highs.\u00a0\u00a0  As the days wore on, institutions added other large short positions as shown below.\u00a0Each of these trades ranked in their respective top-100 and kept price moving lower.\u00a0 As price remained below each print, one could conclude these were bearish positions.\u00a0Had they been bullish positions, price would not have traded lower and remained lower.\u00a0Institutions always defend their positions.\u00a0  Bearishness wasn\u2019t limited to QQQ though.\u00a0Analysis of the mega-cap growth stocks revealed similar bearish positioning.\u00a0See the charts below with notes on each. TSLA\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA)  MSFT\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)  AAPL\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)  META\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)  IWY (NYSE:IWY)\u00a0\u2013 Growth ETF weighted heavily toward growth stocks (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, etc.)  As August began, sentiment had been wildly bullish with many expecting indexes to see all-time highs soon.\u00a0But beginning in June and July, institutions began quietly distributing their shares in growth stocks and positioning themselves for a bearish reversal.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing those outcomes now.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how long this decline will last, or how far down institutions intend to take price.\u00a0But I\u2019ll be waiting patiently for disproportionately large trades to appear at or near relative lows to suggest that institutions are repositioning themselves once again so that I can do the same.\u00a0 Website:\u00a0volumeleaders.com \u2013 7 Day Free Trial.\u00a0 12 tickers are always free to all registered users.\u00a0 Email: info@volumeleaders.com Twitter: @volumeleaders YouTube: @volumeleaders",

The results and guidance were a \u201cdrop the mic\u201d moment that will have a ripple impact on the tech space for the rest of the year, he said. \u201cThis is an unprecedented demand that we are seeing before our eyes in the AI Gold Rush,\u201d the analyst said. The October quarter revenue guidance of $16 billion,\u00a0which is notably above the $12.6 billion consensus, and the \u201cquickly rising whisper numbers on the Street\u201d will ignite a tech rally, he said, adding that the rally will continue into the rest of the year. \u201cWe view these results and guidance as a historical moment for the tech sector speaking the tidal wave of AI spending now on the horizon over the coming years,\u201d Ives said.

                "body": "Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) has thrown its support behind California\u2019s \u201cRight to Repair\u201d bill, marking a significant departure from its\u00a0years-long resistance\u00a0to granting consumers access to repair their electronic devices. What Happened:\u00a0In the letter addressed to California State Senator\u00a0Susan Eggman, Apple urged members of the California legislature to pass the \u201cRight to Repair\u201d bill or \u201cSB 244\u201d as currently drafted.\u00a0 \u201cCalifornia\u2019s final Right to Repair bill should balance device integrity, usability, and physical safety with the desire of consumers to be able to repair, rather than replace, a device when it needs repair. Legislation that correctly balances these concerns will ensure that manufacturers are able to comply with the law while protecting consumers and their devices,\u201d the company said in the letter.\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0Rumor: iPhone 15 Charging Cable Could Be A Whopping 1.5 Meters Long! The bill builds upon the existing\u00a0Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act\u00a0of 1970, mandating manufacturers to provide parts, tools, and documentation for their products for up to seven years, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by AppleInsider.\u00a0 The bill\u2019s similarities to legislation passed in Minnesota earlier in the year signify a growing push to ensure consumer rights and promote sustainability in the technology industry.\u00a0 The Cupertino, California-based tech giant\u2019s unexpected support for the \u201cRight to Repair\u201d bill is a significant victory for advocates seeking fair competition and increased accessibility in the repair market. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0Apple\u2019s endorsement aligns with its 2022\u00a0Self-Service Repair\u00a0program launch, which initially covered iPhones and has since expanded to include select Macs. This program, already compliant with SB 244, empowers users and third-party repair shops by\u00a0providing access to essential repair materials, the report noted.\u00a0 However, before that, for years, Cupertino had staunchly opposed the same bill for which the company has received massive criticism. In 2021, when Apple was among the companies that successfully lobbied against right-to-repair bills in the U.S.,\u00a0Steve Wozniak\u00a0supported the \u201cRight to Repair\u201d movement, saying that the iPhone maker itself emerged from the open technology ethos.\u00a0 Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) CEO Eric Yuan thinks that his employees cannot be as innovative or bond with their colleagues over Zoom calls after the remote working software won the jackpot in 2020 and later due to the Covid-19 pandemic. What Happened: Yuan said in an internal memo that it's not possible to build trust or have a great conversation over Zoom calls, reported Insider. See Also: Unlock the Power of AI: A Step-By-Step Guide To Obtain Your OpenAI API Key As a result, Yuan now wants his employees back in the office as part of a \"structured hybrid approach\". Employees within 50 miles of a Zoom office must work there at least two days a week. \"Quite often, you come up with great ideas, but when we are all on Zoom, it\u2019s really hard. We cannot have a great conversation. We cannot debate each other well because everyone tends to be very friendly when you join a Zoom call,\" Yuan said in the memo. Why It Matters: Zoom was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the shift to remote work in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. It capitalized on the need for remote working solutions, allowing everyone from individuals to companies and even educational institutions to use Zoom and get work done. However, the company's CEO seems to have had a change of heart now that other employees are back in their offices. \"In our early days, we all knew each other. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve hired so many new \u2018Zoomies\u2019 that it\u2019s really hard to build trust,\" Yuan added. Big tech companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have asked their employees to return to the office despite intermittent protests from staff. This has contributed to a decline in demand for video conferencing solutions. As a result, Zoom laid off 1,300 employees, or 15% of its workforce, in February this year. While Yuan said he would take a 98% pay cut, other executives are staring at a 20% cut in the coming year. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

                "title": "Apple Losing Its Bite With Big Whales? Why Institutional Investors Are Picking Different Tech Orchards",
                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the\u00a0world\u2019s most valuable company, has not garnered significant favor among major institutional investors, according to an analysis presented by Morgan Stanley\u2019s\u00a0Erik Woodring\u00a0in a note published on Wednesday.\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0In the second quarter, Apple\u2019s weighting in institutional portfolios decreased by 26 basis points to 5.51%, as stated by Woodring. Despite this, the company\u2019s S&P 500 weighting experienced a 65 basis point increase to 7.72% during the same quarter, resulting in a spread of 2.21% between S&P 500 weighting and active ownership, marking it as the most under-owned large tech entity.\u00a0 The numbers assume importance because the second quarter marked the largest single quarter increase in Apple under-ownership since Morgan Stanley began tracking the data, the analyst said. Additionally, Apple\u2019s current level of under-ownership has been unprecedented since 2008, surpassing\u00a0Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the least-owned large-cap tech stock among institutional investors.\u00a0 Woodring suggests that concerns among investors regarding valuation versus\u00a0short-term fundamentals\u00a0may be contributing to this relatively low institutional ownership.\u00a0 He points out that Apple\u2019s P/E valuation reached a peak of 29 times the earnings per share estimate for calendar year 2024 in July, despite fourth-quarter fiscal year guidance indicating a fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue decline.\u00a0 Woodring also speculates that the gradual increase in Apple\u2019s weighting within the S&P 500 Index could have contributed to this predicament. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock How Apple Compares Vs. Microsoft Source: Morgan Stanley Source: Morgan Stanley Is Pessimism Justified? \u00a0Despite the pessimism among institutions, Woodring said he is encouraged by the fact that the September quarter growth is coming in the right places.  iPhone revenue is expected to inflect to year-over-year growth and the Services revenue will likely reaccelerate to low double-digit growth in the FQ4 and the fiscal year 2024, he added. The company's gross margin tailwinds are still underappreciated by investors, the analyst said. He models a 5% upside to the Street earnings per share estimate for the fiscal year 2024. Woodring expects the stock to outperform as growth accelerates, margins expand and consensus estimates move higher. \u201cLonger-term, we continue to believe the growth of Apple\u2019s installed base and upward pressure on spend per user (potentially catalyzed by a shift to a subscription model) will drive the LTV of Apple\u2019s installed base higher, which is captured in our $270 bull case valuation,\u201d the analyst said. In premarket trading, Apple stock rose 0.45% to $181.93, according to Benzinga Pro data.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is finally embracing the USB-C port on iPhones, with the iPhone 15 series scheduled to launch in the next few weeks, but buyers who want faster data transfer speeds will have to be careful and avoid the standard iPhone 15. What Happened: The iPhone 15 series is widely expected to feature the highly anticipated USB-C port. However, there is a catch that iPhone fans need to be aware of if they are looking to upgrade. See Also: Remote Work Irony: Zoom Struggles With The Very Issue It Was Designed To Address, CEO Calls Employees Back In Office According to tipster and collector of rare Apple products Kosutami, the standard iPhone 15 will use the older USB 2.0 technology despite Apple switching to a USB-C port. This will limit the data transfer as well as charging speeds. Apple is expected to instead give a boost to the more expensive iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, using USB 3.0 technology along with the USB-C port. Why Is It Important: Apple switching to the USB-C port does not guarantee faster data transfer speeds \u2013 it is merely the port design. Apple still has to deploy the faster USB technology, which determines how quickly data is transferred. With the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max expected to cost at least $100 more than their predecessors from last year, Apple could be shoring up some exclusive features to justify the price hike. For instance, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to feature a new Periscope camera that allows for better zooming capabilities. It is also expected to feature a new titanium design. Both the Pro models are also likely to be powered by the faster Apple A17 Bionic chipset, while the standard models will use last year's A16 Bionic chipset instead. With the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max offering a range of more features, including faster data transfer speeds, you might want to avoid the vanilla iPhone 15.

                "title": "This Day In Apple History: Steve Jobs Resigned As CEO 12 Years Ago And Handed Reins To Tim Cook",
                "body": "On August 24, 2011, twelve years ago, Steve Jobs stepped down as the Apple CEO just six weeks before his unfortunate passing, after battling pancreatic cancer for nearly a decade. His resignation marked the end of an era and solidified Jobs' enduring legacy as a pioneer who forever changed how we interact with technology and transformed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) into one of the world's most influential and innovative companies. By the time he resigned in 2011, Jobs' health was a concern for a few years already. His successor and then the COO, Tim Cook, had been steering the company during Jobs' absence this time \u2013 he even led multiple Apple keynotes, so he was more than prepared for the job then. In his typical fashion, Jobs posted a short note announcing his resignation on August 24, 2011. \"I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come,\" Jobs said. The inevitable happened on October 25, 2011 \u2013 43 days after he stepped down, Jobs passed away at his home after a relapse of pancreatic tumor. See Also: Remote Work Irony: Zoom Struggles With The Very Issue It Was Designed To Address, CEO Calls Employees Back In Office This was not the first time that Jobs stepped down as the Apple CEO. In 1983, he handed over the reins to John Sculley in a decision that would lead to his eventual ouster from Apple two years later. Jobs returned to Apple as its CEO in 1997, bringing the company from the brink of bankruptcy to turning it into the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. Jobs brought back with him a new operating system \u2013 NeXTSTEP, which would eventually be renamed to Mac OS X and then macOS. His first goal was to make Apple profitable again, leading to the company axing several projects, including Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc. Under Jobs 2.0, the first major launch was the iPod in 2001 and the iTunes Store, transforming how people streamed and paid for music. But it wasn't until 2007 that Jobs marked one of the biggest achievements of his stint \u2013 the iPhone. His introduction of the device would end up not only being legendary but also pushing the then-market leaders Nokia and BlackBerry out of the race for good. \"Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone,\" Jobs announced prophetically. He introduced the iPhone as a combination of three devices \u2013 a \"widescreen iPod with touch controls\", a \"revolutionary mobile phone\", and a \"breakthrough Internet communicator\". At the time, rival Microsoft scoffed at it, but a few others, like Google, quickly pivoted their own smartphone strategies. Jobs' first health scare emerged in 2003 when he was diagnosed with cancer. After initially resisting an intervention by his doctors, Jobs eventually underwent surgery in 2004 that removed the tumor. However, the disease returned two years later. A rocky few years followed next, with endless rumors about his health. He eventually received a liver transplant and returned to work. What isn't as widely known is the fact that Tim Cook, who took over from Jobs multiple times during the 2000s to steer Apple in his absence, had offered a part of his liver to Jobs for his treatment. Jobs refused the offer. A year and a half after this, Jobs announced a \"leave of absence\" from Apple in January 2011. Seven months later, he stepped down from the top job of the company he co-founded with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Tim Cook has since then led Apple as its CEO. In his last public address, Jobs presented a concept for the new Apple Campus to the Cupertino City Council. It would end up being the last product of Jobs, but he wasn't alive to see it come to life. The Apple Campus was eventually finished in 2017, six years after Jobs left the world.

What happened: Samsung has revealed its massive 57-inch Odyssey Neo G9 gaming monitor, akin to two 32-inch 4K displays side-by-side. Priced at $2,499.99, it will be available in the US this October.

See also: Sony\u2019s PlayStation Portal Handheld Is Launching This Year At $199.99, But There\u2019s A CatchThe Odyssey Neo G9 isn\u2019t entirely new. Samsung teased it last November and officially introduced it at CES in January 2023. The name might ring a bell since Samsung launched a 49-inch version in 2021 but with the resolution of two 1440p displays.  The 2023 model boasts a 57-inch curved Mini LED display, a 240Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 1000 nits. It offers a resolution of 7,680 x 2,160p, resulting in a 32:9 aspect ratio. While such wide monitors are great for multitasking, they may not be ideal for ultra-wide gaming due to potential warping in 3D games. For multitasking, the monitor features picture-in-picture and picture-by-picture display modes. It has one DisplayPort 2.1 port, three HDMI 2.1 ports, and a USB hub. It also supports AMD's FreeSync Premium Pro tech. In October, Samsung announced the 2023 release of its 55-inch Odyssey Ark, available in the US. This display can show up to four inputs simultaneously and includes a built-in KVM switch. Its price remains undisclosed.Image credits \u2013 Samsung NewsroomCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.Read next: How Much Will iPhone 15 Pro Cost?

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) experienced an overnight gap up, currently hovering around the pivotal 445.08 mark. A sustained position above this level will be a bullish sign, potentially targeting 446.31, and with momentum, 447.94. Our ambitious bull target for today stands at 449.42. On the flip side, should 445.08 fail as support, a downturn towards 443.90 is anticipated. Further bearish movement might challenge 443.42, with a significant drop potentially reaching 442.61. Extreme selling might see a dip to 442.04, with the day's bearish low being 441.06. QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ)\u00a0started strong overnight and is now orbiting around 372.91. For bullish dominance, maintaining above 372.91 is crucial. A rally might target 373.82, followed by 375.18 and 375.98. Our bullish top for today is 377.58. However, a struggle to remain above 372.91 could signal a bearish wave, possibly dipping to 371.96 and then 370.91. Further decline might challenge 370.08 and 369.39, with today's bearish floor at 368.57. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw an overnight rise but has retraced those steps. It currently pivots around 180.60. Bulls might first eye 181.25, followed by 182.27 and 182.96, with the day's optimistic target at 183.38. Conversely, a dip below 180.60 might push bears towards 179.36, potentially cascading to 178.61 and 176.18. In a pronounced sell-off, we could be looking at 177.31 as the day's bearish goal. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0trades near 333.46. If it holds, bulls could march towards 335.96 and potentially 337.80. The day's bull high is projected at 339.02. Should 333.46 crumble, bears might target 331.24, with further decline eyeing 328.52. Today's bearish low for Microsoft stands at 326.05. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0showcased overnight vigor, currently trading around 300.23. If maintained, a rise to 301.71 and potentially 304.77 is anticipated. Our high bull target for Meta today stands at 308.16. However, if 300.23 doesn't hold, a decline to 297.33 is possible. Prolonged selling might test 295.97 and further down, 293.91. Our day's bear bottom is set at 291.18. Following an impressive earnings report where they beat on both the top and bottom line, NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is eyed to maintain above the 500.00 threshold. If the bullish sentiment reigns, 510.00 is the immediate target, potentially rallying to 520.00. With immense buying pressure, we could even see a record high of 525.00. Alternatively, a slip below 500.00 might lead bears to 490.00, with additional decline testing 485.00. Our day's bear low for NVIDIA rests at 478.67. Final Word: With the NVIDIA earnings data circulating and a couple of Fed speakers giving their televised remarks, today promises volatility.

                "title": "Elon Musk Is Getting A Charge Out Of Cheech And Chong's Hilarious Cannabis Ads On Twitter/X",
                "body": "Cheech and\u00a0Chong's ads for their cannabis gummies\u00a0have been all over Twitter, in case you haven't noticed. They\u00a0are so prevalent that they\u2019ve become a punchline for fans, critics\u00a0and even Twitter and Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0CEO Elon Musk. Musk recently tweeted a laugh-crying emoji of a meme claiming\u00a0Cheech and\u00a0Chong's weed ads are\u00a0holding up Twitter\u2019s ad revenue. They're Doing Their Share Cheech & Chong's Global Holding, the parent company of the gummies, has been forking over between $250,000 and $500,000 a month on Twitter\u00a0ads\u00a0since earlier this year. Other companies that spend\u00a0more than $500,000 a month on Twitter ads as of June, according to Sensor Tower, include\u00a0Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Apple (NASDAQ:\u00a0AAPL)\u00a0and \u00a0Amazon.com (NASDAQ:\u00a0AMZN),\u00a0noted the Wall St. Journal.\u00a0 Industry experts are opining on why\u00a0Cheech and Chong are blasting their gummies ads\u00a0on Twitter.\u00a0 Some point to\u00a0ad revenue at Twitter, now called X, which has been declining in recent months for reasons we\u2019re all fully, or at least partially\u00a0aware of such as concerns about content moderation and Musk's at times controversial tweets from nuking Mars to selling off all his possessions. As a result, there is apparently less competition for ad space on Twitter, which means that Cheech & Chong's Global can afford to spend more money on ads. First Social Media Site To Welcome Weed Probably the most important consideration\u00a0is that\u00a0Twitter\u00a0became the first social media platform\u00a0to allow cannabis advertising. So\u00a0Cheech & Chong's Global is wisely\u00a0trying to capitalize on\u00a0this new and growing market. Cannabis brands, after all,\u00a0have increased their U.S. ad spending with Twitter by more than 200% month-over-month, on average, through June,\u00a0according to Sensor Tower.\u00a0\u00a0 Twitter At The Recent\u00a0Benzinga\u00a0Cannabis Capital Conference\u00a0\u00a0 Alexa Alianiello,\u00a0Twitter\u2019s\u00a0head of cannabis partnerships attended the\u00a0Benzinga\u00a0Cannabis Capital Conference\u00a0in Miami Beach this past\u00a0April where she\u00a0told the crowd\u00a0and assured the entire cannabis industry\u00a0that \"Twitter has your back. We're a part of this community. We're with you on this journey.\"\u00a0 Similar amazing guests, by the way, will be at the upcoming\u00a0Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference\u00a0in Chicago on Sept 27-28. You really should come by and meet them. Another\u00a0reason why Cheech and Chong are all over Twitter/X\u00a0is that their brand is well-known and respected and their fans are interested in their gummies, so why not spread the word? Furthermore,\u00a0Cheech and Chong fans, including Baby Boomers who loved\u00a0their stoner comedy \u201cUp In Smoke\u201d and happen to be\u00a0the\u00a0fastest-growing group\u00a0of cannabis users in the U.S.,\u00a0have a huge soft spot for the duo and don't mind seeing their smiling faces on Twitter. \u201cWhat you gotta do is get their attention, and once you got their attention, now you can give them some information that is going to astound them somehow, make them laugh or something,\u201d Tommy Chong, 85, said in a recent WSJ interview. \u201cWhatever we are doing, it works.\u201d\u00a0 It\u00a0seems to be working. From where many of us sit,\u00a0Cheech and Chong have our attention.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

                "body": "Deepfake pornography, a disturbing product of the AI era, poses grave concerns for privacy and consent. The technology industry, unwittingly or not, has played a substantial role in the rise of this disconcerting trend. Internet celebrity Kaitlyn Siragusa, more renowned as Amouranth, frequently combats\u00a0unauthorized deepfake videos\u00a0featuring her likeness. Each discovery prompts her team to lodge complaints with search giants like\u00a0Alphabet Inc's\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0Google, but the battle is relentless, Bloomberg\u00a0reports. Also Read:\u00a0YouTube Sets A New Beat, Unveils Pioneering AI Music Principles With Universal Music Group The frequency of nonconsensual pornographic deepfakes has soared, marking a ninefold spike since 2019.\u00a0 An independent analyst, Genevieve Oh, unveiled that around 150,000 videos received 3.8 billion views across 30 platforms as of May 2023.\u00a0 Many platforms brazenly display deepfakes of high-profile celebrities, while others entice users with opportunities to produce custom illicit content. Giants like Google,\u00a0Amazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0AMZN),\u00a0X\u00a0(previously known as\u00a0Twitter), and\u00a0Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0MSFT) offer tools and platforms that inadvertently fuel the deepfake porn epidemic.\u00a0 For instance, Google has been a primary traffic source to these sites, while\u00a0Cloudflare, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NET) and Amazon's web hosting solutions provide infrastructure to several platforms. Victims of nonconsensual deepfake pornography face enormous hurdles in the U.S., given the absence of federal laws that criminalize this content. While 13 states have enacted laws addressing the issue, the legislative landscape remains fractured, and enforcement is challenging, as attorney\u00a0Matthew Ferraro\u00a0of WilmerHale LLP noted. Tech policy professionals and victims are rallying to curtail the spread of deepfakes by pressuring tech conglomerates to delist and disavow AI-generated harmful content.\u00a0 To thwart the ubiquity of deepfakes, these advocates urge search engines and social media platforms to be more proactive.\u00a0 Current statistics from web analytics firm SimilarWeb reveal alarming trends: from July 2020 to July 2023, traffic to top deepfake websites surged by 285%, with Google as the primary traffic source. Many deepfake platforms rely on web hosting services from companies like Cloudflare. Furthermore, tools facilitating the creation of these videos, like Stability AI's open-source model, are readily accessible, perpetuating the proliferation of deepfake content. Users can download several applications recommended for crafting deepfake pornographic content from mobile app stores run by tech titans such as\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0AAPL) and Google. Some of these have witnessed staggering download numbers, reflecting the scale of the issue.

                "body": "Dropbox Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:DBX), an esteemed player in online storage, announced a significant\u00a0shift in its policy. The company will now limit its storage to 5 terabytes for its top-tier plans, blaming excessive resource use by a minority of users. This change impacts the company's \"all the space you need\" plan, Bloomberg\u00a0cites\u00a0from the company blog. Although the company conceived the plan with businesses in mind, some users exploited it for\u00a0cryptocurrency\u00a0mining and other unintended uses, leading to storage consumption thousands of times higher than genuine business customers, Dropbox stated. With a robust clientele exceeding 18 million paid users, Dropbox has built a reputation in cloud storage.\u00a0 In August, Dropbox reported quarterly earnings of 51 cents per share, which beat the consensus of 45 cents. The company reported quarterly sales of $622.50 million, up by 8.70% year-on-year, which beat the consensus of $613.64 million. Total ARR ended at $2.500 billion,\u00a0up by 7.2% Y/Y. Dropbox isn't alone in this. Earlier,\u00a0Alphabet Inc's\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0GOOG) (NASDAQ:\u00a0GOOGL)\u00a0Google\u00a0rebranded its unlimited storage offering, causing a ripple effect in the sector.\u00a0 Following this, several clients reportedly considered switching to Dropbox. Addressing this, a Google representative mentioned the introduction of \"pooled storage\" and clarified the language about storage limits. Under the newly implemented structure, Dropbox will charge users $8 for each additional terabyte, a shift from their previous unlimited plan priced at $24 monthly. Loyal customers using under 35 terabytes can enjoy their existing storage space at unchanged rates for the upcoming five years. As the digital shift continues, online storage demand surges. According to industry experts at IDC, cloud storage spending is set to soar 25% this year, reaching $59.9 billion and potentially hitting $127.8 billion by 2027.\u00a0 Other tech giants like\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0AAPL) and\u00a0Amazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0AMZN) have previously adjusted their cloud storage offerings. Price Action:\u00a0DBX shares traded lower by 0.48% at $27.11 on the last check Thursday.

                "title": "Nvidia's Smashing AI-Fueled Quarter Marks The Official Beginning Of A New Computing Era",
                "body": "On Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) went far beyond estimates with its quarterly performance report. This \u201cdrop the mic\u201d moment, as described by Reuters, led to a 6.5% rise of its New York shares in extended trading, adding to its gains this year during which it became the fifth publicly traded U.S. company to join the \u201ctrillion-dollar club\u201d whose members are Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Moreover, Nvidia\u2019s jaw dropping quarter also lifted other Big Tech stock, including Microsoft who is looking to get its hands on more of Nvidia\u2019s chips, with its stock rising 1.9% during extended trading. Even Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock went up 2.1%. A new computing era has begun and Nvidia is enjoying the results of its bold decision to invest heavily on producing chips that power AI systems long before its rivals Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Micron Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:MU) who focused on servicing markets with existing demand. For the quarter that ended on July 30th, Nvidia\u2019s adjusted revenue amounted to $13.51 billion, topping Refinitiv\u2019s consensus estimate of $11.22 billion. Sales have hit a record as they more than doubled, increasing 88%. The\u00a0data center business, whose output\u00a0includes the A100 and H100 AI chips that are needed to build and run artificial intelligence applications like\u00a0Microsoft-backed\u00a0ChatGPT\u00a0rose 171% YoY to $10.32 billion, going far beyond analyst estimates of $7.69 billion, according to Refinitiv\u2019s data. The gaming segment rose\u00a022% YoY\u00a0to $2.49 billion,\u00a0topping Refinitiv\u2019s consensus estimate of\u00a0$2.4 billion. On the other end,\u00a0Nvidia is spending big to secure its long-term supply needs as it recorded a 53% jump to $11.15 billion of inventory commitments compared to the previous quarter. Net income\u00a0still skyrocketed from last year\u2019s comparable quarter ($656 million, or 26 cents\u00a0a share)\u00a0to $6.19 billion, or $2.48 a share. Adjusted earnings amounted to\u00a0$2.70 per share, topping Refinitiv\u2019s consensus estimate\u00a0of $2.09. While Refinitiv\u2019s consensus estimate for revenue was\u00a0$12.61 billion, Nvidia guided for revenue of about\u00a02% up or down of\u00a0$16 billion\u00a0as it expects sales to continue to soar approximately 170% YoY.\u00a0Adjusted gross margin\u00a0is expected at\u00a072.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, while Refinitiv\u2019s consensus stood at\u00a070.4%. Analysts are expecting Nvidia\u2019s fiscal 2025 data center revenue to expand to $40 billion due to its leadership in AI chips and software to put those chips to work as they power products like ChatGPT that Microsoft integrated in its 365 offerings. ChatGPT\u00a0alone was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units that made a supercomputer that Microsoft had built. The global demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips is likely to continue intensifying, therefore Nvidia\u2019s main job is to secure the supply chain to meet that demand.\u00a0Although\u00a0its\u00a0rival Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0is expected to take some market share away next year with its\u00a0key AI chip,\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s software\u00a0still has\u00a0a years' long lead\u00a0under its belt.\u00a0As\u00a0Wedbush analysts\u00a0Daniel Ives commented,\u00a0Nvidia is \u201cthe purest and best barometer for AI demand\u201d\u00a0and its latest quarterly results that smashed Wall Street\u2019s more than ambitious estimates\u00a0\u00a0could have a ripple impact upon the tech industry that has now undoubtedly opened a new chapter in computing history.\u00a0 DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

                "body": "To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.  Please\u00a0click here\u00a0for a chart of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Note the following: The consensus is $11.2B in sales for the last quarter and $12.5B for the current quarter.\u00a0 The consensus is $18B per quarter starting in 2025.\u00a0There will be many details in the earnings report.\u00a0 However, it is the revenue number and revenue projections that will mostly determine where the stock goes and, by extension, where the entire stock market goes. Many investors on social media are sadly mistaken about what happened yesterday after hours.\u00a0They are pointing to\u00a0 a very expensive evaluation of a trailing PE of 164, a forward PE of 63, and price/sales of 26.\u00a0 Yesterday\u2019s earnings changed it all.\u00a0 If the present trend continues, in The Arora Report analysis, Nvidia will likely earn $10 - $12 in 2024.\u00a0 Using $11 as the mid-point and even after a 29% stock jump after hours, this translates to forward PE of 36.\u00a0 For a stock that performs significantly better than perfection, a forward PE of 36 is reasonable.\u00a0 As a matter of fact, The Arora Report is raising its target on Nvidia to $565 - $615, compared to the closing price of $305.38.\u00a0 Nvidia is in the ZXY Buy Model Portfolio. BRICS have invited these six countries to join: Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and\u00a0U.A.E. BRICS currently consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. BRICS are aiming to\u00a0reduce\u00a0dominance of the\u00a0U.S. dollar.\u00a0 Money flows in\u00a0NVDA\u00a0were extremely positive in after hours after release of the earnings.\u00a0 However, in the premarket, money flows in\u00a0NVDA\u00a0are negative. Money flows after hours were very positive in\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN),\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\u00a0 However, money flows this morning are negative in\u00a0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is \ud83d\udd12.\u00a0 This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0 The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0 If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0 Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "title": "If You Invested $1,000 In Apple Stock When Tim Cook Became The CEO, Here's How Much You'd Have Today",
                "body": "The most valuable public company in the world, technology giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has evolved through several different CEOs and product releases. One of the company\u2019s key transition periods began 12 years ago today. What Happened: On Aug. 24, 2011, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs announced he was stepping down from the company. Tim Cook, who was previously the chief operating officer, was named the new CEO and took over from Jobs, who had served as CEO from 1997 to 2011. While the CEO of the company, Jobs helped usher in an era of product innovation that included iTunes, App Store, iPad and the iPhone. Jobs recommended that Apple make Cook the company\u2019s next CEO, a suggestion that was approved by the company\u2019s Board of Directors. Jobs passed away two months later from complications related to pancreatic cancer. Facing difficult odds of following the legacy of Jobs, Cook has helped steer Apple to new heights, growing its services business and continuing to dominate existing product lines. Cook also helped the company grow in new segments such as streaming, Airpods, the Apple Watch and the company\u2019s M1 chip. Under Cook\u2019s leadership, Apple became the first $2 trillion and the first $3 trillion public company. While investors and analysts were skeptical of Cook leading the company, shareholders have been pleasantly rewarded.

A $1,000 investment at the time of Cook taking over could have purchased 2.68 shares of Apple. Apple has held two stock splits during Cook\u2019s time leading the company. Shares split 7-for-1 in June 2014 and 4-for-1 in August 2020. The splits would have turned the 2.68 shares into 75.04 shares. The $1,000 investment would be worth $13,234.05 today based on a share price of $176.36 for Apple at the time of writing, not including dividends. A $1,000 investment in Apple under Cook\u2019s leadership as CEO would be up 1,223.4% over the course of 12 years. With Cook at the helm as CEO, Apple has been among the best-performing stocks, surpassing the S&P 500. A $1,000 investment in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500, would be worth $4,705.31 over the same time period. This represents a return of 370.5%.

                "body": "Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) highly-anticipated iPhone 15 series launch is just a few weeks away. The rumor mill has been in overdrive in the run-up to the launch, with a massive inflow of everything from rumored iPhone 15 features to the price and more. While the iPhone 14 series may not have moved the needle much for many iPhone fans, Apple has lined up some major upgrades for the iPhone 15 series. If rumors come true, all four iPhone 15 models could offer something for everyone, making this holiday season a good one to upgrade your phone. To make your life easier, we have collated everything we know about the iPhone 15 so far in one place. See Also: iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14: 6 Changes That Will Make The iPhone 15 A Notable Upgrade The iPhone 15 launch date is widely expected to be September 12. Apple and US carriers are preparing for the launch, and a report suggests that US carriers have even asked their employees not to take leaves and be present for a \"major smartphone launch\". While the date is not officially set in stone, all hints point to the iPhone 15 being launched on September 12. If this turns out to be true, iPhone 15 pre-orders could go live on September 18. Apple is rumored to hike the iPhone 15 price this time around. More specifically, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max could see a price hike in the range of $100 to $200. Apple could compensate for this by doubling the storage across all four iPhone 15 models, but we suggest taking that rumor with a pinch of salt. In addition to this, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max could see 8GB of RAM after keeping it unchanged for three years. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will likely borrow the Action Button from the Apple Watch Ultra. The Action Button could support up to nine actions. The latest iOS 17 Beta has given another hint about this feature: a new haptic feedback pattern for the Silent mode. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max could be powered by the Apple A17 Bionic chipset, making them faster than the fastest Android phones this year and the next one. For instance, the A17 Bionic chipset has reportedly beaten the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset by a 47% margin. On the other hand, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are likely to be powered by the A16 Bionic chipset. The top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to receive a major camera upgrade this year \u2013 Apple is rumored to include a periscope camera in its flagship, significantly improving its zooming capabilities. Will the iPhone 15 Pro Max be the best camera phone of the year? Time will tell. One of the most significant changes this year will be the USB Type-C port, replacing the lightning port. Apple\u2019s switch to the more universal port is in response to European Union regulation, making it easier to find a charger since most other smartphones sold over the last few years have the same port. However, the standard iPhone 15 could support only USB 2.0 technology, while the Pro models could get USB 3.0 for faster data transfer speeds. The iPhone 15 series is expected to be powered by up to 20% more dense batteries, helping them last longer than their predecessors. Apple is said to use stacked battery technology borrowed from electric vehicles. This will help Apple maintain the same size as the iPhone 14 models while increasing battery capacity by up to 20%. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to borrow from the Apple Watch Ultra in terms of design \u2013 the frame that runs around the iPhone 15 Pro will now be made of titanium instead of steel. The titanium frame will have a brushed finish instead of the glossy finish that the iPhone 14 series has. Apple could finally move on from the white charging cable and launch color-matched braided USB-C cables with the iPhone 15, according to Apple prototype device collector \"Kosutami\". Apart from this, Apple is also said to extend the USB-C cable length by up to 50%, making it 1.5 meters long.

                "title": "Here's How Apple iPhone 15 Pro Models Could Offer Superior Connectivity And Lesser Network Congestion With Wi-Fi 6E",
                "body": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly gearing up to introduce Wi-Fi 6E capabilities in its upcoming iPhone 15 Pro models in a significant technological leap. This move, powered by the new A17 processor, promises enhanced connectivity and reduced user network congestion. Here, we will go over what Wi-Fi 6E is and what it means for Apple\u2019s flagship phone, as per AppleInsider.See also: What To Expect From iPhone 15 Series? Price Hike, Color-Matched USB-C, Titanium Design, Action Button And More What is Wi-Fi 6E: Wi-Fi 6E introduces a new 6GHz band to the existing Wi-Fi standards. This addition promises reduced network congestion, especially in environments with many devices, offering up to 56 new channels and minimized interference. What is the difference between Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6E? While Wi-Fi 5, previously known as 802.11ac, primarily operates on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, Wi-Fi 6E expands on this by introducing a new 6GHz band. This new band provides enhanced bandwidth and reduces congestion, which is especially beneficial in device-dense environments. What does Wi-Fi 6E mean for the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro? Apple is set to upgrade the iPhone 15 Pro with Wi-Fi 6E capabilities, leveraging the new A17 processor. The iPhone 15 Pro and its variants will harness the A17 processor, ensuring Wi-Fi 6E support. However, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models, powered by the A16 processor, won\u2019t feature this upgrade. Which current Apple Devices are equipped with Wi-Fi 6E? Apple began supporting Wi-Fi 6E with the M2 processor in June 2022. Devices equipped with this processor, such as the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, 12.9-inch iPad Pro, 11-inch iPad Pro, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, all support Wi-Fi 6E. Why is it important: Wi-Fi 6E\u2019s introduction to the iPhone series with the iPhone 15 Pro marks a significant step in enhancing connectivity. However, users need a Wi-Fi 6E-compatible router to benefit from this advancement fully. As technology evolves, it remains essential for users to understand the implications of such upgrades on their devices.

What Happened: The iPhone 15 Pro is expected to support \"at least\" USB 3.2 technology. A new rumor says that Apple could offer a USB 4.0 or Thunderbolt cable capable of achieving data transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps. See Also: What To Expect From iPhone 15 Series? Price Hike, Color-Matched USB-C, Titanium Design, Action Button And More Known Apple collector Kosutami posted these details on X (formerly Twitter), giving us some insight into what else we can expect from the iPhone 15 Pro. The tipster had previously revealed that the standard iPhone 15 could support only USB 2.0, and the faster USB 3.0 protocol could be restricted to the iPhone 15 Pro. Earlier, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo revealed that the iPhone 15 Pro models could support \"at least\" USB 3.2 technology. Joining the dots, it seems like the iPhone 15 Pro could support USB 4.0 as well, which allows users to transfer data at twice the speed of USB 3.0. Faster Charging Speeds, Too? In addition to this, the tipster also says that the Thunderbolt cable could support charging speeds of up to 150W, but that does not mean the iPhone 15 Pro will support those speeds. A previous report suggests that thanks to the USB-C port, the iPhone 15 Pro models could support up to 30% faster charging speeds \u2013 from 27W currently to 35W. Apple could also debut color-matched USB-C cables along with the iPhone 15 series, extending it up to 1.5 meters. The iPhone 15 series is expected to launch on September 12.

                "title": "'Magnificent 7' Tech Bubble To Burst With 'Higher-For-Longer' Rates, Top Wall Street Analyst Warns",
                "body": "As the second half of 2023 unfolds, the U.S. tech sector finds itself at a crossroads, with potential trouble on the horizon, according to a recent assessment by Bank of America\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist, Michael Hartnett.  In his latest report, \u201cThe Flow Show,\u201d Hartnett points to a crucial factor that could shape the fate of tech stocks in the coming months: the waning excess liquidity on Wall Street. Hartnett emphasizes the historic correlation between central bank liquidity and the performance of tech stocks over the past 15 years. However, recent events have defied this correlation, as global liquidity witnessed a contraction of a staggering $3 trillion, while the Nasdaq 100 is teetering towards new highs. The renowned analyst identifies this liquidity crunch as a potential headwind for the U.S. tech sector. Hartnett highlights the remarkable journey of what he dubs the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d in the tech world, consisting of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).  This elite group of stocks has risen 93% year to date, on average, and currently represents 28% of the S&P 500 market cap.  Source: Bank of America Nonetheless, Hartnett, renowned for his prudent insights, points to a broader concern overshadowing the AI and tech buzz \u2014 the discourse around central banks\u2019 stance on interest rates. Bank of America\u2019s team maintains a bearish outlook on stocks for 2023, even as the market rallies. The dominance of U.S. equity and its growth in comparison to global stocks is largely influenced by the Federal Reserve\u2019s current stance. However, this dynamic may shift as we see the end of a \u201ccompliant Fed\u201d that chooses to constrict financial conditions via increased U.S. dollar and bond yields, Hartnett said. Bank of America projects a potential next stop for the S&P 500 Index at 4,200 points, although recognizing that the Jackson Hole Symposium could potentially alter the script.  Hartnett\u2019s message is clear: a paradigm shift is underway. In the past, a \u201clower-for-longer\u201d rate environment fueled a bubble and a boom in the stock market. Now, a \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d rate scenario could potentially trigger a bubble pop and bust.  Hartnett\u2019s parting advice? Prepare for a strategic exit following the Fed\u2019s last rate hike. Read now: Nasdaq In Red Zone As Bearish Engulfing Pattern Hints At Further Downside Photo: Shutterstock",

As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: Overnight, the SPY (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0experienced an upward gap, now hovering around our pivotal 437.92 mark. Bulls would benefit from holding this level firm. Strong bullish activity might propel it towards 438.29, with the next goal being 438.78. A surge beyond 438.78 could lead us to 439.66. The high bull target for today is 440.34. Should 437.92 fail as support, anticipate a dip to 437.02. Increased selling could push it down to 436.51. A significant sell-off from there would aim for 435.59, with a deeper dip targeting 435.06. Today's bearish low target stands at 434.66. Following\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) a modest bounce overnight, the Q's are hovering around 361.41. The bullish trajectory aims for 362.13, with sights set on 363.23. Persistent bullish dominance could raise it to 364.65, with the bull high for the day at 365.59. Sellers might drive it below 361.41, targeting a dip to 360.08. If it falls below this, expect 357.94, then 356.83. Continued sell-offs could lead us to 355.93, then 355.32, with the day's bearish floor at 354.24. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) surged overnight, now trading near 176.84. Bulls aim for 177.31, with increased momentum targeting 178.18. Today's optimistic bullish high is 178.61. Bearish activity could lead us below 176.84, aiming for 176.29, then 175.81. In the event of a significant sell-off, the lowest bearish target is 175.09. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) trades close to 320.05. Bulls aim to solidify this as support, targeting a bounce to 321.51. Strong bullish momentum could push towards 323.17, then 324.81. The day's bullish high target is 326.05. Should 320.05 falter as support, expect a descent to 318.48, then 316.04. Prolonged selling could finally bottom out at a low of 313.61. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) seems to have bottomed overnight, trading near 286.94. Bulls aim to maintain this, targeting an ascent to 288.87, then 291.18. The ambitious aim for today stands at a high bull target of 293.91. Failing to uphold 286.94 could trigger a descent to 285.10, then 285.10 and 284.18. A significant sell-off could aim for 283.08, with the deepest dive today at 280.96. NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) remains flat after overnight activity. Bulls need to sustain 470.17. Strong bullish sentiments aim for 473.81, followed by 478.67.

                "body": "Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) emerged as a darling for hedge funds in the second quarter, with 10 out of the 20 hedge funds Benzinga analyzed having MSFT in their top-5 holdings for the quarter. Microsoft's widespread adoption among major institutional players isn\u2019t surprising, particularly when you consider the tech giant\u2019s performance year-to-date.  Shares skyrocketed by more than nearly 60%, touching highs of $366.78 before paring some of its gains. The surge can be attributed to the company's substantial investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and a significant stake in OpenAI. Outside of the AI fervor, those 10 hedge funds that owned the stock over the quarter were collectively paid nearly $22 million by the company. But it wasn't from share appreciation, it was from dividends. Here\u2019s how the top hedge funds stack up based on their MSFT shares and the dividends they earned: Photo: Shutterstock",

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is \ud83d\udd12.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0 If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0 Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "body": "Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) broke briefly under Thursday\u2019s low-of-day on Friday, after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell spoke at the Jackson Hole Symposium and indicated the central bank hasn\u2019t taken more interest rates off the table. The trading action had Apple looking to print a doji candlestick, which could indicate a higher low has formed. If the candlestick is recognized, and Apple trades higher on Monday, a new uptrend may be on the horizon. An uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart. The higher highs indicate the bulls are in control while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend, with rising lower time frame moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend. Rising longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicate a long-term uptrend. If Apple falls lower on Monday, however, the higher high formed on Wednesday, which negated the downtrend, could serve as a bull trap and the trend lower could continue. If that happens, volatility in the stock market could increase due to how heavily weighted Apple is within the S&P 500. Traders wishing to trade the potential volatility have multiple options, including the ConvexityShares Daily 1.5x SPIKES Futures ETF (NYSE:SPKY). SPKY is a 1.5x leveraged fund, which tracks the SPIKES Futures Short-Term Index and measures volatility in broad-based equities in a similar way to ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF (NYSE:UVXY), which tracks the movement of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. For every 1% daily movement in the SPIKES Futures Short-Term Index, the SPKY fund seeks to move 1.5%, meaning that it\u2019s for short-term trades and should not be held for a long period of time.

The Apple Chart: On Wednesday, Apple formed a higher high at the $181.55 mark, which came in above the most recent lower high, which was printed at the $179.69 mark on Aug. 14. The higher high negated the downtrend but a higher low, above $171.96 hasn\u2019t yet formed to confirm a new uptrend.

                "body": "Apple Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) top security official once\u00a0again faces bribery charges\u00a0linked to alleged iPad-based incentives for procuring firearm permits.\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0A three-judge state appeals court panel ruled that a lower court judge erred in dismissing a bribery charge against Apple\u2019s chief security officer,\u00a0Thomas Moyer. The San Jose-based appeals court reversed this decision after the district attorney challenged it. The appeals panel\u2019s decision, which has broader implications, is set to address a pressing question never before tackled by a California court: Can a public official be swayed by a promise to donate to their office?\u00a0 The panel concluded that such a promise could indeed constitute a bribe,\u00a0reported\u00a0Bloomberg.\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0Your Apple Watch Face Could Soon Change Color Like A Chameleon: What Cupertino\u2019s New Design Patent Reveals The case stems from allegations that Moyer pledged to donate 200 iPads, valued between $50,000 and $80,000, to the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Office. This alleged exchange was made to secure concealed firearm permits for four Apple employees that had been previously withheld. Without a permit, carrying concealed weapons is illegal in California. The situation unfolded in 2017 when Apple sought firearm permits to bolster the security of CEO\u00a0Tim Cook\u00a0following reports of increased threats.\u00a0 A two-year investigation by the district attorney\u2019s office revealed that certain officials within the sheriff\u2019s office had delayed issuing the permits until applicants offered something of value. In response to Moyer\u2019s indictment, Cupertino stated that they conducted an internal investigation into the allegations, finding no wrongdoing on his part. Why It\u2019s Important: Ed Swanson, Moyer\u2019s attorney, previously said that the weapon permits were applied to protect executives and employees\u00a0after shootings at other companies, such as the\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOG) unit\u00a0YouTube\u2019s\u00a0headquarters in 2018. \u201cThey went through the process the way you\u2019re supposed to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no bribe, no quid pro quo.\u201d Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

Apple\u2019s iPad Missteps: Softness around the Apple iPad is partly due to an across-the-industry softness and partly due to the company\u2019s missteps, said Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman in his weekly \u201cPower On\u201d newsletter. The columnist noted that tablet sales of all major manufacturers, including Samsung and Lenovo, have declined following a post-COVID-19 surge. \u201cThere's just not much urgency among consumers to buy a tablet (or upgrade their perfectly functional old one),\u201d Gurman said, adding that most consumers now use larger-screen phones, ruling out the need of iPads. Delving into company\u2019s missteps, the tech writer said Apple has been making only minor iPad updates as of late and that the company has a confused lineup for the product category. To make his case, the columnist noted that the 11-inch iPad Pro and iPad Air are similar in size and appearance and that the extra $200 for the Pro version is for the Pro Motion, LiDAR, an M2 chip and a second camera \u2014 features, he said, aren\u2019t compelling. Gurman also noted that Apple\u2019s products compete with one another, as the iPad competes with the Mac lineup, and the perplexing approach to the iPad software. \u201cStage Manager, which is meant to make it easier to multitask, can still be difficult to use. And Apple has been reluctant to bring more Mac-like functionality to the platform,\u201d he said. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock Good iPad News Down Line The Line:  Apple will likely launch an overhauled iPad Pro in 2024, marking the first major update to the product since 2018, Gurman said. \u201cThe next iPad Pro models \u2014\u00a0codenamed\u00a0J717, J718, J720 and\u00a0J721 \u2014\u00a0will shift to the next-generation M3 chip,\u201d the Apple writer said. They will also be Apple's first tablets with OLED displays,\u00a0the same types of screens used on the iPhone since the X model in 2017, making the display crisper and\u00a0brighter with more accurate colors, he said. The new models, Gurman said, will come in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes. He also flagged the revamped Magic Keyboard, which will likely make the iPad Pro look more like a laptop than the current setup and adds a larger trackpad.  The columnist also expects the new models, which are not expected to be part of the company\u2019s big launch scheduled next month, to give iPad sales a boost.  \u201cI'm\u00a0not anticipating anything other than minor updates to the company's other tablets before then,\u201d he added. Apple ended Friday\u2019s session up 1.26% at $178.61, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Top\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) executives appear to have unwittingly fallen prey to a cleverly disguised fake\u00a0Tim Cook\u00a0account on\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0Instagram\u00a0account.\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0In a bizarre twist, it seems that several high-ranking Apple executives, including\u00a0Lisa Jackson\u00a0and\u00a0Alan Dye, were following a suspicious Instagram account under the username @tim.d.cook.\u00a0 The account, which surfaced in July 2023, garnered attention after it posted content seemingly related to Apple\u2019s CEO,\u00a0reported\u00a09To5Mac.\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta Moves To Disrupt Apple, Google App Store Monopoly The first post, published on Aug. 20, featured two high-quality photographs, apparently taken with an iPhone, in honor of World Photography Day. Three days later, on Aug. 23, the account shared a 30-second promotional video for a campaign in collaboration with\u00a03DPets. However, the report confirmed that Cook had no association with the account, citing sources familiar with the matter.\u00a0 At the time of writing, the supposed Instagram account of the Apple CEO was not accessible on the platform.\u00a0 Cook is known for his reserved and professional demeanor on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and does not typically engage in personal content sharing.\u00a0 This made the Instagram account appear credible at first glance, especially given the recent controversies\u00a0surrounding Twitter\u2019s transformation\u00a0into\u00a0X\u00a0under the ownership of\u00a0Elon Musk. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0Previously, in January this year, an Instagram imposter account was posing as\u00a0Ethereum\u00a0(CRYPTO: ETH) co-creator\u00a0Vitalik Buterin\u00a0allegedly engaged over 570,000 users through sponsored ads and a staking scam.\u00a0 The account had 24 posts and a display image of Buterin, which resembled his Twitter profile picture. It also had a link to his\u00a0blog for added authenticity.\u00a0 Not only Instagram, Musk\u2019s Twitter, now rebranded as X, has also faced its fair share of impersonators havoc. Last year, the tech billionaire\u2019s plan for a\u00a0\u201crock solid\u201d Twitter Blue relaunch\u00a0was postponed until the team became confident about preventing impersonations.\u00a0\u00a0 Photo by Laura Hutton on Shutterstock Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "The future of Taiwan is largely dependent on the dynamics between the U.S. and China, George Yeo, former Foreign Minister of Singapore, said on Sunday. What Happened: Yeo, in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with the South China Morning Post, downplayed the significance of Taiwan\u2019s upcoming presidential election in January. He pointed out that the key actors in the Taiwan issue have been notably measured in their recent actions. Taiwan\u2019s Vice-President and presidential hopeful,\u00a0William Lai Ching-te, has recently visited the U.S. and Paraguay. Yeo characterized these trips as \u201ccalibrated to be low profile,\u201d as Lai did not engage with any U.S. officials or legislators. Yeo also highlighted China\u2019s subdued reaction to Lai\u2019s visit, saying, \u201cIt was not only his wish, but it was an American requirement, and China's response was equally calibrated.\u201d See Also:\u00a0Mark Cuban Rants About Vivek Ramaswamy On X, Calls Him \u2018Donald Trump With A Vocabulary\u2019 Yeo, also a respected observer of Asian geopolitics, said the Taiwan polls \"are important, but whether or not relations between America and China are good or bad depend on America and China; Taiwan is only a piece on the chessboard.\" \"If the Taiwanese want to be played on that chessboard, then they will offer themselves, and the Americans will decide to play, or not.\" \u201cTaiwan by itself will not determine the issue of war and peace; it's America, and its relationship with China,\u201d Yeo remarked. Why It Matters: The tensions between China and Taiwan have been escalating, with Chinese President\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0signaling China\u2019s military readiness for a potential assault on Taiwan,\u00a0as showcased in\u00a0a recent eight-part documentary series featuring the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Kyle Bass, founder of U.S. investment firm Hayman Capital Management,\u00a0warned that Xi\u2018s determination to \u201cbring war to the West\u201d could potentially lead to an invasion of Taiwan by 2024. This potential conflict could have significant global implications. Terry Gou, founder of Foxconn, a key supplier for Apple Inc.,\u00a0predicted a Wall Street crash\u00a0in the event of a China-Taiwan war, stating that it could take as little as \u201c10 seconds\u201d for such a catastrophe to occur.

                "title": "How Much $1,000 Invested In Google When It Bought Android 18 Years Ago Is Worth Now",
                "body": "One of the smartest moves of Google, which is now part of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), is its purchase of Android on May 11, 2005. The Steal Deal: After Samsung and HTC decided to give Android a pass, Google stepped in and bought the company, known for its mobile operating system, by paying a paltry price of $50 million. Incidentally, Google paid a hefty sum of $1.65 billion in 2006 to buy YouTube, which has also evolved into a major profit center for the company over the years. Later, in 2010, Google's then vice president of corporate development, David Lawee, said the Android buy was the best deal ever. Android Inc. was founded by the quartet of Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White in Palo Alto, California, in Oct. 2003. The company originally set out to create the OS for digital cameras and then realized the business was not lucrative. Then, the company decided to try its hands on a handset OS that would take on Nokia's Symbian, the market leader then, and Microsoft's Windows Mobile OS. The Android founding members joined Google when the latter bought the former. Google Grows With Android: Google, which was known merely as a search company, entered the mobile communications market in Dec. 2006. Apple's iPhone launch in 2017 meant Google had more work to do to bring out a compelling product to the market. The first commercially available smartphone armed with Android OS, the HTC Dream, was announced in Sept. 2008. Since then, Android has rolled out numerous updates that finetuned and improved upon the previous versions. A fun fact is that Google names each update alphabetically after a dessert or sugar treat, with the first version named Cupcake. Google then went on to launch its own phone in Oct. 2016 under the brand name Pixel. The latest data from StatCounter, a web traffic analysis website, shows Android had a 70.9% share of the mobile operating system market as of July 2023 compared to 28.36% for Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS. Google revealed in May 2022 that there are over 3 billion active Android devices globally. Android 14, the latest OS, will incorporate the company's advances in generative AI that will help personalize Android phones, Alphabet said on the second-quarter earnings call last month. See Also: Best Technology Stocks Right Now How Google Makes Money From Android: Android apps and services fetch Alphabet money as the company pockets a portion of these sales through the Google Play Store. The OS indirectly leads users to spend time and money on other Google services like YouTube. Android also helps Google avoid costs incurred for being the default search engine of any other OS. Incidentally, Google reportedly paid Apple $15 billion for retaining Google as the default search engine in devices powered by the tech giant\u2019s iOS. Returns From Investing In Google: A $1,000 invested in Alphabet, then known as Google, on the day of the Android buy would have fetched the company 173.6 shares. The stock closed the session on May 11, 2005, at $5.76 on a split-adjusted basis. The same 173.6 shares would be worth $22,689.2 now. Alphabet's Class C shares traded under the ticker GOOG closed Friday's session up 0.21% at $130.69, according to Benzinga Pro data. This suggests Google returned 2,270% over the 18 years compared to the S&P 500's 276% gain and the Invesco QQQ Trust's (NASDAQ:QQQ) 1,069% advance.

Steve Jobs, known for being a marketing maverick, wrote the advertisement copy for his and his fellow co-founder's first product by hand. It has now been sold at an auction for a whopping $175,759, six times its original asking price. See Also: Save $560 On The 13-inch Apple MacBook Air 2020 The ad copy for the Apple-1 computer written by Jobs is an early draft and was available on auction at RR Auctions. Launched with a mere 8 kilobytes of RAM, the ad lists out other features of the Apple-1 computer, like a full CRT terminal, expandable RAM up to 65 kilobytes via an external edge connector, and more. Jobs tries to sell the computer by calling it \"A real deal\". The copy is undersigned \"Steven Jobs\". Collectors' Favorite: Apple artifacts have fetched collectors huge sums of money. Earlier last week, bids for a sealed iPhone from 2007 fetched its owner a whopping $45,000, which is 75 times its asking price. Another rare 4GB iPhone fetched a record $190,000. Steve Jobs, who resigned over 12 years ago in 2011 before eventually passing away six weeks later, has been among the favorites, too. For instance, a 1983 letter from Steve Jobs with his signature fetched its owner a record $480,000. Earlier, the original Apple founding contract fetched $1.59 million in 2011, more than 10x the initial estimates of $150,000.

                "body": "Jackson Hole Week comes to a close with a pretty ugly weekly candle. With DXY still strong, it's pretty hard for me to be bullish on the higher time frame right now. That weekly volume imbalance just below 4300 is where I am looking. Range is pretty big right now, meaning that even retracements higher can be pretty large. Should be a nice week for traders! Non Farm Payroll comes in on Friday morning.   NQ has an untouched bullish imbalance starting at 14432, which would line up with the volume imbalance on ES. Unlike ES, Nasdaq did take out the previous weekly high last week AND held the weekly volume imbalance to the tick... Similar game plan as I watch DXY closely for additional information.  Another winning week for the dollar, making it 6 in a row. Liquidity at 104.69 and 105.88. A break above the swing high at 104.69 would create a bullish breaker on the weekly (low, high, lower low, then break on the previous high) which I'd view as support moving forward. As long as DXY remains hot, it is hard for me to be bullish on the indices.  While I lean bearish on the higher time frames, SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) did take out the swing high Friday morning, creating a bullish market structure. While it is technically bullish on the 30, I am not totally sold, as there are no bullish imbalances in the area I look for dip buys (.62-.79). There are order blocks that have respected, but it doesn't give me the extra layer of confidence I'd prefer.  On a larger outlook, AAPL\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is approaching 50% of the range and heading for some resistance. 3 levels to beat on AAPL, the last one being 182.78 to switch things up.  TSLA\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) took out recent swing high and created a bullish imbalance in discount (below 50% of the swing range).  GOOGL\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) looks pretty weak in comparison to some other big names. Multiple bearish levels overhead. Can switch up the short term structure with a break of 130.76.  AMZN\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) resistance level at both the 50% level and the 70% from Thursday's high to Friday's low. Liquidity was taken out Friday prior to the bounce.  MRNA (NASDAQ:MRNA) holding up pretty well since the big run up last week. Bulls want to see a hold of the -2 standard deviation bullish imbalance for another leg higher.  NVDA (NASDAQ:NVDA) if the market wants to reverse higher, I believe NVDA has to bounce from the bullish imbalance from 457-455. Failure to do so and liquidity at 448.76 could be next.  MSFT (NASDAQ:MSFT) lots of resistance overhead, but relative equal highs were left behind at 334.72... Bulls want to see price hold the bullish imbalance right below for a move higher. A bounce wouldn't be unrealistic from this level with such a large range.  AMD\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD) big range and a lot of imbalances overhead...

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has retained the top spot in global wearable shipments during the June 2023 quarter despite a slight decline in its growth rate. What Happened: Global technology analyst firm Canalys has reported that Apple has retained the top spot in global wearable shipments during the June quarter despite a downturn in its shipments compared to the last year. See Also: Steve Jobs\u2019 Handwritten Ad Sells For Over 2,300x Of The Price Of Apple-1 It Was Written For This is impressive, especially considering that the top five list is dominated by companies making affordable wearable makers, with Xiaomi, Noise, and Fire Boltt taking the second, fourth, and fifth spots, respectively. Softer global economic conditions weighed on Apple's performance, with the company witnessing a 3% decline in wearable shipments. Xiaomi's share remained unchanged, while Huawei, Noise, and Fire Boltt reported 13%, 93%, and 86% growth, respectively. Comfortably Ahead: Despite its rivals catching up in absolute numbers, Apple is still comfortably ahead of them, with an 18% share in global wearable shipments during the June 2023 quarter. Xiaomi was a distant second with a share of just 11%, despite its far more affordable fitness trackers and smart bands accounting for many of its wearable sales. Huawei was a close third with a share of 10%. Two Indian brands \u2013 Noise and Fire Boltt- comprised the top five list. However, like Xiaomi, these two brands also juggle in the affordable segment. According to another analyst firm, IDC, the Indian wearable market had an average selling price of $25.6 at the end of the June 2023 quarter. This is a far cry from Apple's cheapest smartwatch, the Apple Watch SE, which is currently retailing for $249. It remains to be seen if Apple retains its top position despite a challenging macroeconomic environment.

                "body": "To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.  Please\u00a0click here\u00a0for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). Note the following: We have been sharing with you that the Chinese government has been trying very hard to prop up its stock market.\u00a0The Chinese government cut the tax on stock trading for the first time since the great financial crash of 2008.\u00a0The CSI 300, the main index of Mainland Chinese stocks, jumped 5.5% at first, but then the gains started fading.\u00a0Investors should take note that everytime the Chinese government tries to prop up the stock market, the stock market first jumps and then gives up most of the gains. In The Arora Report analysis, the reason the rallies are not sustained is that the economic data in China is weak.\u00a0\u00a0 In the early trade, money flows are positive in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc.

For longer-term, please see oil ratings. The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (NYSE:USO). Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is range bound. Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is \ud83d\udd12.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0 Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.\u00a0 The Arora Report correctly called the 2008 financial crash, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, the COVID crash, the post-COVID bull market, and the 2022 bear market.\u00a0 Please click here to sign up for a free forever Generate Wealth Newsletter.

Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) has seen a modest rise in the overnight session, hovering around our pivotal 441.06 mark. For bullish momentum, we're eyeing a rally towards 441.62 and 442.04. A robust bullish sign would be maintaining 442.04 as a support level. If buying remains strong, bulls might aim for 442.61. A surge past 442.61 could lead to a high of 443.42 for the day. Should 441.06 fail as support, we anticipate a decline towards 440.34. With sustained selling, the bearish target is 439.66. A significant drop below this could lead to 438.78. If selling persists, 438.29 will be the level to watch. The day's ultimate bearish target is 437.92. The Q's (NASDAQ:QQQ)\u00a0have shown a slight uptrend overnight, currently around 365.59. Bullish sentiments would push towards 366.69 and potentially 367.52 with strong buying. A further rise could see 368.57. For a bullish day, maintaining above 368.57 is crucial, with a high target of 370.08. If sellers dominate, a drop through 365.59 to 364.65 is expected. A struggle above 364.65 could lead to a bearish trend towards 363.23, then 362.13 and 361.41. The day's bearish target is 360.08. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has edged up overnight, now around 179.36. Bulls would want to defend 179.36, aiming for 180.60 and a day's high of 181.25. For bearish sentiments, a decline below 179.36 could lead to 178.61 and further to 178.18. Persistent selling might push towards 177.31, with a day's low target of 176.29. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) hovers around 324.81. Bulls aim to maintain this, pushing towards 326.05 and potentially 328.52. The day's bullish target is 331.24. If 324.81 fails as support, bears might push towards 323.17 and further to 321.51. The day's bearish target is 320.05. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) has risen slightly overnight, now around 286.94. Bulls aim for 288.87 and potentially 291.18, with a day's high of 293.91. If 286.94 isn't maintained, bears might target 285.10, then 284.18 and 283.08. A significant drop could lead to 280.96, with a day's low of 279.15. For NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), bulls aim to maintain 464.95, pushing towards 470.17 and potentially 473.81. The day's bullish target is 478.67. If 464.95 isn't held, bears might target 458.20, then 461.49 and 458.20. The day's bearish target is 454.09.

                "title": "Steve Jobs-Signed Check Sells For Over $135K Alongside Apple Rarities Like Sealed iPhone",
                "body": "Last week marked the 12-year anniversary of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs stepping down from the leadership\u00a0role he held from 1997 to 2011. On the anniversary of Jobs' departure as Apple's CEO, several Apple-associated items also concluded their auctions. Here are some of the standout items that were sold. What Happened: RR Auction sold several pieces related to Jobs and Apple as part of its \u201cApple, Jobs and Computer Hardware\u201d auction. The auction follows several pieces of Jobs memorabilia that have fetched six figures in the last several years. Here\u2019s a look at some of the highlights from the RR Auction. Steve Jobs Handwritten Ad Copy For Apple-1: This unique piece of Apple memorabilia sold for $175,759, which was around 6x the original estimate prior to the auction starting. The rough draft showcased Jobs' vision for advertising the Apple-1, signed as \"Steven Jobs.\" The piece also features the home address and phone number of Jobs\u2019 parents, which was the original headquarters for Apple. \u201cThe sale of this original handwritten Apple-1 advertisement draft by Steve Jobs is a remarkable testament to the visionary genius of one of the most influential figures in modern technology,\u201d RR Auction Executive VP Bobby Livingston said. \u201cThis artifact offers a tangible connection to the inception of the personal computing revolution.\u201d Steve Jobs And Steve Wozniak Signed Check: A check from 1976 signed by Apple co-founders Jobs and Wozniak was sold for $135,261. The check is dated March 19, 1976 and is listed as check #2. The check was a temporary one, issued after Apple\u2019s first-ever bank account had been opened. Apple\u2019s official founding date is April 1, 1976, meaning this check is older than Apple. The check also came before Apple signed its agreement for Jobs and Wozniak to each have 45% of the company and Ron Wayne to own 10%. Jobs and Wozniak signed the check, and it was issued to Ramlor Inc, a printed circuit board company, for $116.97. The check represents one of Apple's earliest financial transactions, with a pre-auction estimate of $50,000. \u00a0 \u201cThis temporary Apple check is one of the first documents ever signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, predating the famous Apple agreement with Ron Wayne,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cThe second Apple check ever written paid for the initial batch of Apple 1 circuit boards \u2013 the financial transaction that started the revolution.\u201d Apple-1 Computer: A fully functional Apple-1 Computer signed by Wozniak was sold for $223,520. The estimate for the item prior to auction was $200,000. Apple iPhone: A factory-sealed first-generation iPhone with 8GB storage fetched $55,999 at auction, surpassing its $20,000 pre-auction estimate by more than double. 1984 Prototype Mouse: A prototype mouse for the 1984 Apple computer was sold for $17,269. iPod Touch First Generation Sealed: A sealed first-generation iPod Touch sold for $4,533. Jobs Business Cards: The auction featured multiple business cards previously owned by Jobs. A NeXT business card linked to Jobs fetched $4,520, while a Pixar card associated with him went for $3,245. Employee Award: A five-year service award for an Apple employee signed by Jobs sold for $13,589. Tim Cook Signed iPhone: While the auction featured mostly older items related to Jobs and Wozniak, an Apple iPhone 11 signed by current Apple CEO Tim Cook sold for $1,513. Related Link: Tim Cook's True Reason For Joining Steve Jobs In Apple's Journey, It Wasn't About The Money\u00a0 Why It\u2019s Important: Apple is the most valuable company in the world today and home of iconic products like the MacBook, iPhone, iPod and iPad. Jobs was instrumental in the creation of many of Apple\u2019s top products. Since Jobs' death in 2011, items with his autograph have been highly sought after by collectors and fans of Apple products. Sealed Apple products have also grown in popularity and demand. A sealed original iPod was just sold for a record $29,000 with a buyout offer approved by shareholders on the\u00a0fractional investment platform Rally. Along with the sealed iPod, Rally has offered several Apple and Jobs-related products over the years, allowing investors and Apple enthusiasts an opportunity to capitalize on the rising value of these collectibles. Rally has an Apple 1 computer signed by Wozniak, a 1983 Apple Lisa Computer, a 1984 MacWorld #1 magazine signed by Jobs, a famous 1983 jacket worn by Jobs and several other items. With Jobs no longer with the world, items bearing his signature might see a continued rise in value. As one of the top companies in the world, Apple continues to have a large following and many of its early items will be seen as collector's items for years to come.\u00a0 Read Next: Exclusive: Rally Rd CEO On Video Games, Apple Assets And Growth For Fractional Investing\u00a0 Photo: Shutterstock",

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will soon start issuing settlements in the 2017 batterygate issue, but now users are complaining about the iPhone 14 battery health, in a sort of batterygate redux ahead of the iPhone 15 launch. What Happened: Many users are now noticing a massive drop in the iPhone 14 battery health. Several of them are complaining that the battery health of their iPhone 14 has degraded considerably faster than previous iPhones, pointing at a possible issue plaguing Apple's latest smartphone. See Also: Will Your iPhone Get The iOS 17 Update? Check The List Here Several users have taken to X (formerly Twitter) to complain about the sudden, unexpected drop in iPhone 14 battery health \u2013 this includes The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern, The Verge's Tom Warren, and blogger Apple Hub, among dozens of others. Stern reported that her iPhone 14 Pro's battery health is already down to 88% in less than a year of usage. Apple Store staff reportedly told her that her charge cycles have hit 450 \u2013 a charge cycle means a full 100% charge from 0%. Charging your phone's battery from 50% to 100% is counted as a half-charge cycle. Others chimed in, too, with 9to5Google's Max Weinbach stating that his iPhone 14 Pro Max's battery health is down to 89%. Most of the complaints suggest that the iPhone 14 battery health has fallen to the low 90s and high 80s, with Stern's 88% being amongst the lowest we have noticed so far. Apple's policy on the battery life of iPhones suggests that most users are complaining about iPhone 14 battery health falling considerably faster than previous iPhones will not be serviced under warranty. Apple says that iPhone batteries are designed to retain up to 80% of their capacity at 500 complete charges. In this case, Stern's iPhone 14 Pro is still comfortably higher, with 88% battery health at 450 charging cycles. Apple's one-year iPhone warranty covers defective batteries that fall below this 80% mark at less than 500 cycles. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

                "body": "It's already the biggest company by market cap, but it might end up being the \"world's largest smartphone brand by 2023\" if TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is right. What Happened: Kuo, a known Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) analyst, said in a Monday blog post that the Cupertino, California-based company is expected to ship about 220\u2013225 million units in 2023, edging out Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.'s (OTC:SSNLF) smartphone shipments, which were reportedly reduced to 220 million units this year. Kuo suggested that if Apple maintained its current momentum, it might not just match but surpass Samsung\u2019s smartphone shipments, staking its claim as the top dog in the industry. Despite the buzz of delays clouding the launch of iPhone 15, particularly the iPhone 15 Pro Max, Kuo\u2019s dive into supply chain dynamics seemed to incinerate any concerns. Mass shipments for the iPhone 15 Pro Max are expected to kick off this week, and Apple was simultaneously ramping up shipments of its legacy models, the analyst said in his blog post.Read Also: Apple Batterygate Redux? Users Complain iPhone 14 Battery Health Is Falling Faster Apple\u2019s bullish roadmap extends beyond 2023 with a shipment target of 250 million units for 2024 \u2014 to that end, the analyst saw a 5% to 10% year-over-year growth rate for Apple during that time frame. In comparison, Samsung\u2019s conservative internal forecasts for the same year offer Apple a distinct edge, Kuo said, likely extending its newfound lead into 2024. Supply Chain Woes: Challenges are a looming cloud over the iPhone 15 series, with fears of shipment cuts making rounds in the market. However, Kuo projects a more reassuring outlook, saying he expected Apple to ship 80 million iPhone 15 series units, dismissing the more conservative 70 to 80 million unit estimates. With Samsung\u2019s conservative future outlook and Apple\u2019s aggressive shipment goals, the Cupertino-based company seems ready to wear the crown. The next few years could be a watershed moment for Apple, Kuo said, solidifying its supremacy in the smartphone landscape. Apple could see a rebound in its stock price ahead of new product announcements in September and could become the world's largest smartphone brand by 2023 and 2024 / Apple\u57289\u6708\u65b0\u7522\u54c1\u767c\u5e03\u524d\u6216\u8fce\u4f86\u80a1\u50f9\u53cd\u5f48\u6a5f\u6703\uff0c\u4e26\u53ef\u671b\u57282023\u82072024\u5e74\u6210\u70ba\u5168\u7403\u6700\u5927\u667a\u6167\u578b\u624b\u6a5f\u54c1\u724chttps://t.co/TFqmssVFKE Read Next: EXCLUSIVE: Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is Key 2024 Election Issue For Young Voters",

On the one hand, Raimondo warned against zero tolerance on national security while acknowledging how the U.S. aspired for a\u00a0robust Chinese economy.\u00a0 Nvidia has a high exposure to China due to the fact that China and Hong Kong contributed about 25% or $7.1 billion to the chipmaker\u2019s total sales in fiscal year 2022. An additional $8.5 billion in sales came from Taiwan, which is not subject to similar export restrictions but is nonetheless caught in the middle of the escalating tensions between the United States and China.

                "body": "AirDrop, a beloved feature among\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) device users, has long simplified file-sharing within the iOS and Mac ecosystem. However, its exclusivity poses challenges for users wanting to share with\u00a0Android\u00a0devices (smartphone that runs on the operating system developed by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google) and vice versa.\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0Popular tech YouTuber\u00a0Marques Brownlee\u00a0took to\u00a0Twitter, now rebranded as\u00a0X, and shared a solution he discovered through a post by\u00a0Mishaal Rahman\u00a0on the same platform. In his post, Rahman talked about a method to use AirDrop with an Android phone called\u00a0WarpShare. See Also:\u00a0How To Cast \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Spells With Siri On Your iPhone WarpShare is developed by the creators of the MoKee custom ROM and allows Android users to send files to a MacBook using AirDrop\u2019s protocol without requiring any installations on the Mac side. This ingenious workaround breaks the one-way barrier, enabling Android-to-Mac transfers, but does not support transfers to iPhones or iPads. To use WarpShare effectively, users\u2019 Macs must have AirDrop discoverability set to \u201ceveryone\u201d to bypass the need for Apple-signed certificates. However, it doesn\u2019t enable Mac-to-Android sharing due to\u00a0Apple Wireless Direct Link\u00a0or AWDL limitations. This app uses AirDrop to send files from your Android phone to your Macbook!Yes, it actually uses AirDrop.

This app leverages\u00a0Nearby Share\u00a0capabilities\u00a0and allows Android phones to recognize the designated Mac as a sharing destination. While WarpShare requires sideloading or compiling from source code, NearDrop provides a more user-friendly experience for Mac users seeking to bridge the Android-Mac file-sharing gap. Happy Monday!

                "body": "In the smartphone arena, the longstanding rivalry between\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) and\u00a0Samsung Electronics\u00a0(OTC:SSNLF) has witnessed a noticeable reversal over four years, with the former now poised to take the lead in an unexpected area. What Happened:\u00a0An Apple leaker, who goes by the name of\u00a0Ice Universe\u00a0on\u00a0Twitter (now\u00a0X), shared two images comparing the screen-to-body ratio on Samsung flagship models with iPhones. The first image was from 2019 when the\u00a0Samsung Galaxy Note 10+\u00a0had a relatively sleeker bezel compared to the\u00a0iPhone 11 Pro Max. The second image reflected the upcoming models from the two tech giants, comparing the\u00a0Samsung Galaxy S24\u00a0and\u00a0iPhone 15 Ultra.\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0Apple Execs Duped By Fake Tim Cook Instagram Account \u2013 What\u2019s Really Going On? This world is so absurd. Four years ago, when I was holding a Samsung Galaxy Note10+ in my left hand and an iPhone 11 Pro Max in my right hand, I never thought that four years later, the bezel of the iPhone would surpass that of Samsung, and even more so many. pic.twitter.com/k4SoDlMfaG Previously, the same leaker said that Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhone 15 Pro Max\u00a0model could debut with a front display with incredibly thin bezels, measuring just 1.55 mm \u2014 a feat that could soon make it the world\u2019s thinnest smartphone bezel. This move is consistent with the broader trend in the industry, where a higher screen-to-body ratio has become a highly sought-after feature. China\u2019s\u00a0Xiaomi\u2019s 13\u00a0model currently holds the title of\u00a0thinnest smartphone bezels with a 1.81 mm. Another leaker, ShrimpApplePro on X, shared the same information, stating that Cupertino\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro models would come with comparatively\u00a0thinner bezels than its predecessor.\u00a0 Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0Apple has been slow regarding reducing the borders around the screen on their iPhones. They are still selling the\u00a0iPhone SE, which seems outdated compared to smartphones designed in the current scenario. However, the tech giant gradually started progressing and even got\u00a0rid of the big boat-shaped notch\u00a0at the top of the screen. The borders around the iPhone screens are also getting thinner every year.\u00a0 Apple is expected to launch iPhone 15 lineup on September 12.

                "body": "Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) most expensive iPhone this year, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, could become the top-selling model thanks to the periscope camera that Apple is expected to add this year. What Happened: The top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to be Apple's best-selling iPhone despite being the most expensive too, according to noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The reason is simple \u2013 Apple is expected to include a periscope camera this year on its flagship iPhone. See Also: iPhone 15 Launch Likely On September 12: Thinner Bezels, Periscope Camera And Action Button, Everything We Know So Far According to Kuo, the iPhone 15 Pro Max alone is expected to account for up to 40% of iPhone 15 series shipments. It is also expected to see a 10-20% increase in shipments when compared to its predecessor, the iPhone 14 Pro Max. \"It means Apple is optimistic about the selling point of the periscope, which is only available in iPhone 15 Pro Max,\" Kuo said. The iPhone 15 Pro Max will be the only iPhone 15 model to sport the new periscope camera. The upcoming iPhone flagship is expected to feature a triple camera setup on the back with the new lens system. A periscope lens system would allow Apple to achieve superior lossless zoom at levels like 5x or higher compared to a traditional system. Beating The Economic Blues: Apple's iPhones dominated the smartphone industry's profits for a long time despite only grabbing a small market share in terms of shipments. However, iPhones seem to be gaining even on that front \u2013 a new report shows that the top ten smartphones by shipments in the first six months of 2023 are all iPhones. In fact, the most expensive iPhone models \u2013 the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max \u2013 led the growth. iPhone 15 Launch Date: The iPhone 15 series is expected to launch on September 12, with pre-orders expected to go live on September 18. From the USB-C port to a new titanium design and the Action Button, the iPhone 15 series promises to pack a serious punch this year. At the same time, Apple could also hike the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max prices by $100 to $200, so its impact on sales will also be worth watching out for.

                "body": "Intel\u00a0Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:INTC) eyes a next-generation\u00a0data center chip. Likely for a 2024 launch, this chip promises to provide over double the computational capability for each unit of power consumed amid global efforts to reduce energy consumption.\u00a0 Intel showcased its latest innovation during a semiconductor conference at Stanford University in Silicon Valley. The anticipated \"Sierra Forest\" chip from Intel will likely present an impressive 240% enhancement in performance per watt when juxtaposed with its current data center counterpart, Reuters reports. Last week,\u00a0Nvidia Corp's\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0quarterly report indicated\u00a0that the artificial intelligence frenzy is here to stay. Intel looks to tap the surging chip demand triggered by\u00a0the AI frenzy\u00a0involving tech giants, including\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL),\u00a0Google\u00a0parent\u00a0Alphabet Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:META),\u00a0Amazon.Com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN),\u00a0Microsoft Corp's\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT). The global data center chip industry generated $11.7 billion in 2022 and will likely reach $45.3 billion by 2032, registering a CAGR of 14.6% from 2023 to 2032.\u00a0 Data centers, the backbone of the online world, are notorious for their hefty power consumption. Consequently, there's mounting pressure on tech giants to maintain or scale down their energy usage, spurring chip manufacturers to innovate and extract more processing juice from each chip. Ampere Computing, an ambitious startup initiated by former Intel higher-ups, pioneered launching an energy-efficient chip tailored for cloud computing tasks.\u00a0 Industry leaders Intel and\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD) haven't been far behind, with AMD launching its contender this June. Intel's announcement on Monday reaffirmed that its \"Sierra Forest\" chip remains on course for a launch next year. Furthermore, Intel is diversifying its data center chips into two distinct segments.\u00a0 While high on performance, the \"Granite Rapids\" version will be more power-hungry, in contrast to the energy-conserving \"Sierra Forest\" variant. Ronak Singhal, a distinguished senior fellow at Intel, highlighted that customers can seamlessly consolidate legacy software onto fewer servers, enabling enhanced power savings with the upcoming chips.\u00a0 \"I can get power savings by moving something that's currently on five, 10, or 15 different servers into a single new chip,\" explained Singhal.\u00a0 This approach will increase the density of operations and curtail system costs for clients.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is \ud83d\udd12.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

The messaging service has previously offered a web wrapped version of its web app as a macOS app, but the new version is a native app that makes\u00a0more efficient use of system resources. It also features a tweaked three-panel interface that offers easier access to archived chats, starred messages, and calls. Although it\u2019s now widely available, the new app is still in beta for the time being. WABetaInfo\u00a0reports that the new Mac app is built using\u00a0Catalyst, Apple\u2019s cross-platform development framework that\u2019s mainly talked about as a way of easily bringing iPad apps to the Mac. But despite an\u00a0official WhatsApp iPad app being rumored for years, Meta is yet to announce or release it publicly. With any luck, the release of the new Catalyst-based macOS app is a sign that an iPad app could still be on the way.\u00a0 The new WhatsApp macOS app has been in\u00a0closed beta for a few months, but you\u2019ve had to be in its limited TestFlight beta to get access. Now, however, anyone can download the app from WhatsApp\u2019s website, after which it can be linked with the service\u2019s iOS or Android apps using the standard QR code-based system.",

                "title": "Market Clubhouse Morning Memo - August 29th, 2023 (Trade Strategy For SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, GOOGL, And NVDA)",
                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, GOOGL, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: The SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is hovering around our pivotal level of 442.61. For bullish traders, we're looking for a strong rally towards 443.42 today. If momentum continues, expect the price to rise to 443.90, which should then act as a significant support level. A strong buyer presence could push the target to 445.08. Breaking above 445.08 could lead to a high of 446.31 for the day. Should 442.61 fail to act as support, we anticipate a downward move to 442.04 and then 441.62. If selling persists, the bears could challenge the 441.06 level. A breach here could send the price down to our support level at 440.34, with 439.66 as the next test point. The day's ultimate bearish target is 438.78. The QQQ\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ)\u00a0is trading around our key level of 366.69. For a bullish scenario, we aim for an initial rise to 367.52. A strong buying surge could propel the price to 368.57, which would indicate bullish control. Further buying could push the price to 369.39, with a high target of 370.08 for the day. If sellers dominate, expect a decline to 365.59 and then to our support at 364.65. If 364.65 can't hold, bears may drive the price down to 363.23, and potentially to 362.13 and 361.41. The bearish target for the day is 360.08. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is trading below our key level of 180.60. For the bulls, reclaiming and holding 180.60 as support is crucial. With strong buying, the next target is 181.25, with a high for the day at 182.27. On the bearish side, if the price falls below 179.36, we could see a drop to 178.61 and then 178.18. Persistent selling could drive the price down to 177.31, with a low target for the day at 176.29. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading above our key level of 321.51. For bullish action, holding 321.51 as support is essential, with a rally target of 323.17. Sustained bullish momentum could push the price to 324.81, with a high target of 326.05. If 321.51 fails as support, expect the bears to aim for 320.05. A breakdown here could lead to a bearish target of 318.48 for the day. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) is trading around our key level of 288.87. For bullish action, holding this level as support is crucial, aiming for 291.19. If that level holds, the next target is 293.91, with a high for the day at 295.97. If 288.87 can't hold, expect a bearish move to 286.94, and potentially to 285.10 and 284.18. Continued selling could lead to 283.08, with an aggressive bear target at 279.15. Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is trading around our key level of 131.76. For bullish action, we're aiming for 132.22. If that holds, the next target is 132.84, with a high for the day at 133.78. If 131.76 fails to hold, expect a bearish move to 131.28. A breakdown could lead to 130.41, with a bearish target for the day at 129.52. For NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), the key level for bulls is 464.95. If buyers dominate, the first target is 470.17, followed by 473.81. Strong buying could push the price to a high of 478.67 for the day. If 464.95 fails to hold, expect a bearish move to 458.20. A breakdown could lead to 461.49 and then 458.20, with a bearish target for the day at 454.09. Final Word: Today features several key data releases that could introduce volatility.

                "title": "iPhone 15 Launch Rumors: Thinner Bezels, Periscope Camera And Action Button, Everything We Know So Far",
                "body": "The iPhone 15 launch is all set for September 12, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking another step towards its dream iPhone \u2013 one with no bezels and no camera cutouts. With the iPhone 15 shaping up to be the biggest upgrade in years, Apple is planning an in-person launch event at its campus, Apple Park in Cupertino, California. When will the iPhone 15 launch? The iPhone 15 series is reportedly set to launch on September 12, with some major upgrades like thinner bezels, camera upgrades, a new Action Button, and other design and hardware improvements. See Also: Apple\u2019s Upcoming iOS 17 Update: iPhone Users Must Prepare For A Significant Change While previous reports said that US carriers had asked their employees not to take leaves in September for a \"major smartphone launch\", Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has now confirmed the iPhone 15 launch date, which is September 12. Apple tends to launch iPhones on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, which aligns with the general trend. Previous reports suggest that Apple is also expected to hike the US iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max prices by $100. Gurman adds that outside of the US, all four models could see a price hike to varying degrees. Given that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are expected to feature some significant design and hardware upgrades, the $100 price hike might be justified. Thinner Bezels: Amongst the major iPhone 15 upgrades this year will be the thinner bezels \u2013 more specifically, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are expected to have 1.5mm borders around the display, significantly down from 2.2mm on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. To achieve this, Apple is borrowing another leaf from the Apple Watch playbook \u2013 it is reportedly using a display technology called low-injection pressure overmolding, or LIPO. Titanium Body: The iPhone 15 Pro models are also said to feature another major design change \u2013 a titanium body instead of a steel frame. Apple has borrowed this design change from the Apple Watch Ultra. USB Type-C Port: The USB Type-C port is all set to make its debut on the iPhone \u2013 all four iPhone 15 models are expected to use the universal Type-C port in compliance with new European Union regulations. According to reports, the \u2018Pro' models are expected to support USB 4.0 technology, supporting data transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps. However, there is a catch: if you want these faster speeds, you must avoid this iPhone 15 model. Periscope Camera: The top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to receive a significant camera upgrade \u2013 Apple is expected to include a periscope camera in its flagship, significantly improving its zooming capabilities. Action Button: The iPhone 15 series is expected to sport another borrowed feature from the Apple Watch Ultra \u2013 a programmable Action Button. It will replace the mute switch and allow users to program up to nine actions, including a flashlight toggle, low power mode, do not disturb mode, and more. Dynamic Island: All four iPhone 15 models are expected to feature Dynamic Island, a feature that has been restricted to the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. Performance Boost: The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are expected to be powered by the Apple A16 Bionic chipset, while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are expected to feature a 3-nanometer A17 Bionic chipset. A new report suggests that Apple could pack in an extra GPU core to give the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone Pro Max a performance boost. These two iPhone 15 models could also get 8GB RAM, up from 6GB on their iPhone 14 Pro siblings. Stacked Battery Technology: Lastly, the iPhone 15 series is expected to be powered by up to 20% more dense batteries, helping them last longer than their predecessors. Apple is said to use stacked battery technology borrowed from electric vehicles, helping it pack in denser batteries without increasing the size. The shift to the USB-C port is also expected to increase the charging speeds by up to 30% \u2013 from 27W to 35W. Storage Bump: A recent report suggests that Apple could finally increase the baseline storage to 256GB, up from 128GB. That said, we suggest taking this with a grain of salt, given the track record of the source of the leak. Color-Matched USB-C Cable: Apple could finally move on from the white charging cable and launch color-matched braided USB-C cables with the iPhone 15, according to Apple prototype device collector \u201cKosutami\u201d.

                "body": "https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-hopes-chinese-suppliers-can-solve-vision-pros-display-challenges When Apple dealt with Chinese manufacturers in the past, it was to buy low-level components such as small metal parts, paper boxes and batteries. For advanced parts such as displays and chips, the iPhone maker turned to firms headquartered in the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Times are changing. Apple is currently testing advanced displays made by two Chinese suppliers for possible inclusion in future models of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headsets, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. The two suppliers, BOE Technology and SeeYa Technology, are among a crop of Chinese companies that are making high-end technologies, spurred by government policies designed to reduce China\u2019s reliance on foreign tech while also making its homegrown firms more competitive.",

                "body": "Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is making headlines today with three significant stories that are shaping the company's trajectory. Here's a quick dive into the top three stories related to the tech giant. Supply Chain Diversification:\u00a0 Apple is strategically diversifying its supply chain amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and China.\u00a0 The tech giant is now looking towards India and Vietnam as potential delivery hubs.\u00a0 While this move comes with its own set of challenges, such as less mature supply chain infrastructures and potential service disruptions, the shift is already showing results. India, for instance, has seen a threefold increase in iPhone production in the past fiscal year.\u00a0 However, this diversification might also lead to potential delivery hiccups and increased costs, possibly affecting the pricing of Apple products,\u00a0Techradar\u00a0reports. Right to Repair Movement:\u00a0 In a surprising turn of events, Apple has shown support for the 'right to repair' movement, aligning with growing consumer demands for more autonomy over their devices.\u00a0 This movement, backed by government legislation, empowers consumers to repair and modify their electronics without being tied down to the manufacturer's services.\u00a0 While this shift is indicative of a broader industry trend, it also exposes Apple to potential patent and copyright infringement lawsuits. Interestingly, India is positioning itself to become a major player in the global repair service market -\u00a0More on this. iPhone 15's Game-Changing Design:\u00a0 Leaks suggest that Apple's iPhone 15 might be a game-changer in the smartphone market, especially when it comes to the screen-to-body ratio.\u00a0 Preliminary images indicate that the iPhone 15 Pro Max could potentially boast the world's slimmest smartphone bezel, surpassing even Samsung's flagship models.\u00a0 This design evolution is in line with Apple's consistent efforts to minimize the borders around their screens. The much-anticipated iPhone 15 series is slated for a grand launch on September 12th.\u00a0Read the full story here.

                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) sent out invites for its main hardware launch event at which the tech giant is widely expected to unveil the next iteration of its flagship product \u2013 the iPhone. What Happened: Apple has planned the iPhone launch event for Sept. 12, according to the invite shared by Greg Joswiak, the company's senior vice president of marketing, on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. He captioned the invite as \"Wonder awaits\" and posted it with the hashtag #AppleEvent. The event's tagline is \u201cWonderlust.\u201d Wonder awaits. September 12. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/48gRXu3Ux4 The itinerary provided on the Apple Event page shows that the launch will kickstart at 1 p.m. EDT and will be broadcast from the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California. Since the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, the company has been using pre-recorded videos to launch its iPhone. The event will be streamed on Apple.com and on the Apple TV app. The company may also host limited members from the media to watch the presentation in person. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock What To Expect: Apple is expected to unveil four variants of the iPhone: the iPhone 15 (6.1 inches), iPhone 15 Plus (6.7 inches), iPhone 15 Pro (6.1 inches) and iPhone 15 Pro Max (6.1 inches). Prominent Apple leaker and Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said that with the iPhone 15, the tech giant will move another step toward having a \u201ctruly all-screen\u201d iPhone with no borders around the display and no cutouts for cameras or sensors. The standard iPhone 15 model will replace the notch for the Dynamic Island, and the Pro and Pro Max displays will be made using a new tech called low-injection pressure over-molding or LIPO, he said. The new process will shrink the border size around the display to 1.5 millimeters compared to 2.2 millimeters on current iPhones. Gurman expects the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models to get the biggest updates since the device added 5G capability three years ago. The iPhone 15 series will likely get the A16 chip that was previously part of the Pro versions, have major camera upgrades and come with a USB-C instead of the lightning connector, enabling faster data transfer speeds for those who still sync with a cable, he said. For the Pro models, Gurman expects a new design partly made of stronger, lighter and more premium titanium. They will likely retain the frosted glass back of the prior few phones, but the edges connecting the side and front will likely be less sharp than before. The Apple specialist said the new Pro models will move to a 3-nanometer chip that is noticeably snappier. Gurman also modeled minor price increases across all four variants. At the very least, the Pro models could be pricier in the U.S., given the move to titanium and the costlier\u00a0camera system, he said. Apple Watch: Apple is also expected to launch the next iterations of its Apple Watch. The Apple Watch Series 8 and a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra may also drop in at the event.  Apple shares have underperformed the rest of the mega-cap tech stocks this year. The tech giant's shares are up over 41% year-to-date compared to Nvidia's 233% gain and Meta Platform's 146% jump. At last check Tuesday, Apple stock rose 2.16% to $184.10, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Highly-awaited Martin Scorsese film\u00a0\u2018Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019\u00a0is slated for\u00a0a global release on October\u00a020, 2023, foregoing its limited theatrical run. What Happened: As reported by\u00a0AppleInsider\u00a0on Tuesday, the film will stream on Apple TV+, shifting from its original plan of limited release in the United States. The change in the release strategy comes as a decision made in collaboration with\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) and Paramount. The movie, penned by Eric Roth and Scorsese, boasts a star ensemble featuring\u00a0Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, Robert\u00a0De Niro, Jesse Plemons, Tantoo\u00a0Cardinal, and Cara Jade Myers. Based on a book by David Grann,\u00a0\u2018Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019\u00a0unfolds an FBI investigation into the\u00a0murders of the Osage people\u00a0in Oklahoma during the 1920s. See Also:\u00a0How To Take The Perfect Moon Shot Using An iPhone 14 Following its global release, the film will be available for streaming on Apple TV+, a service that costs $6.99 per month or is\u00a0available via any tier of\u00a0Apple One. Why It Matters: This announcement is the latest move in a series of strategic decisions by Apple. Back in May 2020,\u00a0Apple secured the rights\u00a0to finance Scorsese\u2019s film, marking its venture into movies. The film, originally planned for production with Paramount, saw a change in course when the budget began to swell, as reported in\u00a0May 2021. Earlier in March 2023,\u00a0Apple planned a limited theatrical release\u00a0for the film before its debut on the TV+ platform. However, the recent decision reflects a strategic shift in Apple\u2019s approach to expanding its reach.

                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Tuesday sent out invites for its Sept. 12 iPhone launch event, which goes with the tagline \u2018Wonderlust.\" Deepwater Asset Management's co-founder and Managing Partner Gene Munster weighed in on the invite and what it signaled regarding the event. What Happened: The tagline \"Wonderlust\" is a combination of the words Wanderlust and wonder, Munster said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.  The word wonder may have been used to suggest Apple is releasing new products that previously we could only imagine, he said. \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, the wow factor in the iPhone Pro will likely be anchored with the improved camera,\u201d the fund manager said. The wanderlust part, according to Munster, is about the exploration that points to the Apple Watch. The general consensus is that Apple will release two watches, namely the Apple Watch Series 9 and a second-generation Ultra Watch, he said. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock The pixelated logo pointed toward some new material or finishes for the iPhone 15 Pro series and the Apple Watch Ultra, Munster said. The tech expert said he is rooting for a blue iPhone 15 Pro. \u201cOn my long shot wish list, a new iPhone mini,\u201d Munster. Apple discontinued the mini-series, which has a display size below six inches, after the iPhone 13,\u00a0 due to its poor uptake. Why It's Important: Apple's September hardware launch events are always important because it launches the newest iPhones, which fetch the company a bulk of its revenue. Munster said the products launched in September will likely lay the groundwork for Apple's revenue growth going from a 1% drop in the September quarter to a 5% increase in the December quarter. Apple closed Tuesday's session up 2.18% at $184.12, according to Benzinga Pro. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could spring a surprise with an unexpected product launch at its highly-anticipated September 12 launch event titled \u2018Wonderlust'. What Happened: Apple is now expected to launch a new pair of AirPods at its Sept. 12 event, with the charging case expected to feature a USB-C port instead of the Lightning port, reported Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. See Also: iPhone 15 Launch Rumors: Thinner Bezels, Periscope Camera And Action Button, Everything We Know So Far This coincides with Apple's decision to switch to the USB-C port on the iPhones, in accordance with European Union regulations. Apple has long been rumored to launch AirPods with a USB-C port, with the most recent report from March from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggesting that we could see a pair of AirPods with the USB-C port. It's not clear yet if this will be an entirely new version of AirPods or just an existing one with the new port. However, switching to the USB-C port on the iPhones makes this a good time for Apple to make the switch on the AirPods as well, given that these two products are often used together more often than not. It's not just the ease of use that having a single port offers \u2013 European Union regulation makes it mandatory for iPhones and other small devices to charge via the USB-C port, so this gives Apple the required push to make the switch on the AirPods as well. About The September 12 \u2018Wonderlust' Event: Apple is widely expected to launch the iPhone 15 series at its September 12 \u2018Wonderlust' event. The first signs of this launch date were revealed earlier in August when major US carriers had reportedly asked their employees to be present for a major smartphone launch. In addition to the iPhone 15 series, we could also see the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 being introduced on September 12. On the software front, the iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, and watchOS 10 updates are expected to be rolled out to the public.

                "body": "Investment guru Warren Buffett, who turns 93 on Wednesday, has appealed to a new generation of investors with his portfolio approach to investing in value stocks. The Man, Myth & Legend: The nonagenarian heads the investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) in the dual role of chairman and CEO. The company has a portfolio of subsidiary companies engaged in diverse businesses as well as stakes in companies. Born to a stock broker in Omaha, Buffett took inspiration from his father, who reportedly introduced him to investing and books. The legendary investor had his first tryst with investing at a very early age of 11 years and pocketed a small profit out of it.  He, however, was unhappy that he did not hold the investment longer to rake in fatter profits \u2013 which apparently taught him the virtue of not being swayed by the overwhelming emotions of \"greed and fear\" that are characteristic of investing. Buffett, known as the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" first invested in Berkshire, which was then a struggling textile manufacturer in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He took control of Berkshire in 1965. Although he did not succeed in turning around the textile business, he slowly and steadily developed it as a holding company. It was around that time Charlie Munger began associating with Buffett before formally joining as vice chairman of Berkshire in 1978. Munger, who is a big fan of renowned value investor Benjamin Graham, tweaked the latter's ideology to buying excellent companies at fair prices and holding on to them. Standing testimony to the duo's success, Berkshire's Class A shares have soared from around $270 in the early 1980s to over $540,000 currently. In Berkshire's annual letter to shareholders in February, Buffett said the company's satisfactory performance over the years has been due to a dozen \"truly good decisions,\" which he said could be made once every five years, and the forgotten advantage that favors long-term investors. See Also: Best Value Stocks Berkshire's Top Equity Bets: About 78% of Berkshire\u2019s aggregate fair value of equity investments were concentrated in five companies at the end of the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, the fair values of these investments were as follows: A hypothetical equal-weighted investment of an aggregate of $1,000 in these companies at the end of 2022 would be worth: The cumulative return in absolute dollars is $1,044.92, a return of 4.5% over a period of six months. This compares to the S&P 500's 17.14% return. The returns take into account only stock price appreciation. These companies have been consistent dividend payers and if the dividend streams paid out thrice this year were also accounted for, the returns would have been even greater. For instance, Berkshire is likely to have earned $219.74 million in dividend income from Apple alone following the payout the tech giant announced in the June quarter. In premarket trading, Berkshire's Class A shares were edging down 0,29% at $542,000, according to Benzinga Pro data.

                "body": "Last week,\u00a0Alphabet Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0Google\u00a0shared plans to trial a brand-new feature for a smoother song-searching experience on YouTube. Android users can search for songs on\u00a0YouTube\u00a0by humming or singing under the new feature. Also Read:\u00a0Spotify Expands Video Offering, Takes On YouTube And TikTok With Full-Length Music Videos: Report Users in the beta group can toggle the new feature from YouTube's voice search and \"hum or record the song you're searching for three or more seconds,\" the New York Post\u00a0cites\u00a0from the company blog. The new feature could intensify YouTube's rivalry with\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)-owned app Shazam. Google also aims to relieve some pressure on creators with the feature apart from a smoother song search experience for users. In 2020, Google reportedly launched the feature on the Google app, Google Search widget, and Google Assistant. However, now users need to hum the tune for 10 - 15 seconds rather than three. The algorithms capture every detail hummed, like accompanying instruments and the voice's timbre and tone.\u00a0 When a user hums a melody into Search, the machine learning models transform the audio into a number-based sequence representing the song's melody.\u00a0 It then compares these sequences to thousands of songs worldwide and identifies potential matches in real-time. Google's models can identify songs from various sources, including human singing, whistling or humming, and studio recordings. YouTube ads revenue hit $7.67 billion in\u00a0the second quarter. Alphabet's second-quarter revenue increased 7% year-over-year to $74.60 billion, which beat the consensus of $65.42 billion. The company reported quarterly earnings of $1.44 per share, which beat analyst estimates of $1.20 per share. In June, YouTube shared plans to launch its first official shopping channel for live commerce in South Korea, marking its official shopping channel\u00a0debut in any country.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is \ud83d\udd12.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0 If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "title": "Is Cathie Wood The Next Warren Buffett? Apple, Tesla Define Their Investment Strategies",
                "body": "With a track record of 60-plus\u00a0years of strong returns for investors, Warren Buffett, who turns 93 Wednesday,\u00a0is considered one of the all-time\u00a0legendary investors. While many strive to emulate Buffett, and some have even been dubbed the \"next Buffett,\" meeting the lofty standards set by the Oracle of Omaha is no small feat. One name that could stand out as the next\u00a0Buffett is Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of Ark Invest.  Don't miss Benzinga's one-on-one interview with Wood, airing at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, Aug. 30 on \"The Raz Report.\"\u00a0 What Happened: Over the years, names such as\u00a0Bill Ackman, Eddie Lampert, Chamath Palihapitiya and even disgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried have all been called the \"next Buffett.\" Although no one has yet managed to fill those sizable shoes, Wood could be on track to become the Buffett of her generation, particularly if her high-stakes investment areas yield significant returns. Ark Invest provides a range of ETFs focusing on various specialized investment sectors, with its flagship fund, the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), showcasing the firm's most strongest trading convictions.\u00a0 The other ETFs include the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW), Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS:ARKG), Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ), Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF) and the Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX). A visit to Ark's website reveals that the firm positions itself as the hub for ETFs centered on disruptive innovation. \u201cArk aims to deliver long-term capital appreciation by investing in the leaders, enablers, and beneficiaries of disruptive innovation,\u201d the Ark website states. The investment themes that Ark funds focus on include artificial intelligence, space exploration, electric vehicles, genomics, sports betting, digital payments, cryptocurrency, digital consumers and 3D printing. Related Link: Cathie Wood Channels Warren Buffett With Year-End Investing Message\u00a0 Wood, Buffett's Differences,\u00a0Similarities: While Wood could become the next Buffett, their investment approaches are notably distinct. Buffett liked value stocks for years and continues to invest in many blue-chip, dividend-paying names. Wood favors technology stocks and growth stocks, which often trade with no dividends and can\u00a0be unprofitable. This investment strategy has shown the differences between investors and the public markets over the years. When value stocks were favored by investors for safety during the high inflation period in 2021 and 2022, Buffett saw outsized returns for Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B), the company he leads. Growth stocks fell out of favor with the market and investors and Ark Funds saw declines in 2022. Outside this recent time frame, growth stocks have gained popularity among investors, particularly as the ranks of retail investors have expanded. Wood may have been among those who were early to recognize this trend. Benzinga previously shared three pieces of advice from Buffett when it comes to investing.\u00a0These guidelines include holding stocks for an extended period, investing in sectors you're familiar with\u00a0and acquiring stocks at sensible valuations. Wood follows some of these ideas by buying what she knows in the key areas of innovation and disruption. Known for investing in high-growth names, Wood has also considered price-to-sales ratios for stocks to see which ones might be valued better than others. When it comes to owning stocks for the long term, she seems to adhere to this principle with stocks such as\u00a0Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and several others remaining in the portfolio since the inception of the funds. Buffett\u00a0held several of the stocks in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio for decades, despite increases in valuation and the potential to take profits. Wood\u00a0cashed out of holdings after they ran up in value, with Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) being a recent example. Wood was early with investing in Nvidia, but when valuations soared, cashed out and missed\u00a0out on more profits along the way. Ultimately, Wood channels Buffett in many ways with high-conviction trade ideas and being early to investment ideas. One of the biggest differences between Buffett and Wood may center around their favorite stock. While Buffett has traditionally been cautious about technology and high-growth stocks, Berkshire Hathaway bought shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2016 and has added to the position over time. Apple now makes up a huge part of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, with a 915,560,382-share stake valued at over $160 billion. Wood favors Tesla, a stock she has\u00a0been bullish on for years.\u00a0Buffett passed on a chance to invest in Tesla in the past, a decision that CEO Elon Musk frequently brings to his attention. Buffett has several investments in electric vehicle companies, but doesn\u2019t own Tesla, and also has large investments in oil stocks, in stark contrast to Wood's portfolio choices. Top Holdings: There is minimal overlap between Buffett and Wood\u00a0given their sharp difference in investment styles. The top 10\u00a0holdings in the flagship Ark Innovation ETF are: While looking at the names, not all are profitable and there are no dividends to be had for investors. Compare that with the top 10\u00a0stock holdings for Berkshire Hathaway, which includes profitable companies and high dividend payouts: Performance: Buffett has enjoyed sizable returns over the years, often outperforming the S&P 500, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\u00a0(NYSE:SPY). From 1965 to 2022, Berkshire Hathaway had compounded annual gains of 19.8%, as reported by CNBC. The S&P 500 had\u00a0compounded annual returns of 9.9% over the same time period. Berkshire Hathaway shares are up 25.2% over the last year and up 70.8% over the last five years. The Ark Innovation ETF is up 2.7% over the last year and down 12.8% over the last five years. Since its inception in 2014, the ETF is up 10.8%. In recent years, Wood's returns have declined, negatively impacting the five-year and lifetime performance of her ETFs, which were once among the best-performing specialty funds. With growth names back in favor, the Ark Innovation ETF is up 42% year-to-date in 2023, beating the 15.5% performance of Berkshire Hathaway. All the Ark ETFs are outperforming Berkshire Hathaway on a year-to-date basis. Check out Benzinga\u2019s exclusive interview with Wood on the Raz Report Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.

                "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Cathie Wood Tells Benzinga Why Tesla Should Trade As A Tech Stock",
                "body": "Electric vehicle leader Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the best-performing stocks of the last five years, up over 1,000%. Among the people who have been bullish on the company for years is Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Invest, who correctly predicted a Tesla price target years before others joined the bull case. Wood told Benzinga CEO Jason Raznick\u00a0that Tesla\u2019s valuation could be much higher, and it should trade\u00a0more like a high-growth tech stock than an automotive stock. Watch\u00a0the full exclusive interview with Wood on the\u00a0\"The\u00a0Raz Report\":\u00a0  What Happened: Tesla is one of a limited number of companies to hit a $1-trillion market capitalization, a feat that traditional automotive companies like Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) have never achieved. While it\u2019s well-known for its electric vehicles, Tesla also operates in fields like solar, energy storage, artificial intelligence and is growing its presence in autonomous driving and robotics. For this reason, Wood said that Tesla should trade like a technology stock and not like traditional automakers, something that analysts and Tesla bears can\u2019t grasp. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re getting it wrong,\u201d Wood told Benzinga on \"The Raz Report.\" Autonomous taxi platforms could be \u201cthe biggest AI project in the world,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cTesla, because of its positioning with AI, it is the only auto company or tech company that has designed its own chip for autonomous driving.\u201d Wood referenced Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the comparison to Tesla and its decision to make its own chip. \u201cIt has taken a leaf from Apple\u2019s book.\u00a0Apple redefined the cell phone market by designing a chip that turned the cell phone into a computer.\u201d Wood told viewers to look at companies like Motorola, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), Nokia Corporation (NYSE:NOK) and BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB) and see where they are today. \"They didn\u2019t define the market correctly, and neither have auto companies.\" Related Link: Tesla Q2 Earnings Highlights: Revenue Beat, EPS Beat, Cybertruck Update And More\u00a0 What\u2019s Next: Wood said Tesla having its own chips and pushing into autonomous vehicles is important for the company's future valuation. \u201cThis is not an auto play. This is an autonomous taxi platform play with software-as-a-service like margins,\u201d Wood said. She noted that autonomous has 80%-plus\u00a0gross margins for Tesla, which is important given its current normalized 20% gross margins. Tesla remains a top-five holding in\u00a0the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) and Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ). The electric vehicle manufacturer has a market capitalization of $814 billion, which ranks significantly higher than automotive companies. The market capitalization of Ford and General Motors are around $46 billion each. Toyota Motors (NYSE:TM) has a market capitalization of $226 billion. Tesla also trades with higher price-to-sales and price-to-earnings multiples to its automotive peers, something Wood said should continue going forward.

                "body": "3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) shares traded higher Wednesday, alongside shares of 3D printing stocks, in reaction to a report suggesting Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) is testing using 3D printers to make devices. What To Know: According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is testing the use of a 3D printing technique called binder jetting to\u00a0produce some of its future smartwatches. By using 3D printers to create the steel chassis for the watches, Apple can avoid cutting the large slabs of metal into the required shape, saving the company time, reducing the amount of material, and ultimately streamlining the supply chain. The technique has been in the works for at least three years, recently being tested on steel cases for the Apple Watch Series 9 over the past few months. While the 3D-printing work is in its early stages, and the cost of transitioning to 3D-printed watch cases is expensive, there are plans to broaden the process to other products over the next few years if the testing is successful.

                "body": "Presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy was known\u00a0to rap during his college days, but he may face competition for the title of best musician in the 2024 race. For the second time this year, a song featuring former President Donald Trump has been released. What Happened: A mug shot of Trump went viral on social media and is now the subject of a top rap song on the iTunes chart, a music service from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). The song \u201cFirst Day Out\u201d isn\u2019t actually from Trump himself, instead, it uses artificial intelligence to portray the former president rapping about the \u201cradical left\u201d and his mug shot, as reported by the New York Post. The song, which was produced by artist Hi-Rez, hit number two on the iTunes chart according to the report. Hi Rez portrays the former president as \u201cTrump the Don\u201d in the rap. A video on Twitter sharing the song has been seen over 2.9 million times. The song features shout-outs to people associated with Trump and to his \u201cMAGA\u201d base, referencing his popular \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan that was used as a rallying cry, for merchandise and inspired the creation of the Point Bridge America First ETF (BATS:MAGA). \u201cThese DA\u2019s acting silly, my mug shot is worth a billi,\u201d the fake Trump raps in the song. The fake Trump also references his mug shot merch making a \u201cmilli,\u201d which comes as it was reported that the former president saw an increase in campaign fundraising after the mug shot. Hi-Rez said he made the minute-and-a-half song in 30 minutes as \u201can absolute joke.\u201d While Trump has yet to comment on the video, his son Donald Trump Jr. called the song \u201chilarious.\u201d Related Link: Vivek 'Da Vek' Ramaswamy: The 2024 Presidential Candidate Who Might Just Rap His Inauguration\u00a0 Why It\u2019s Important: While this track uses an AI-generated Trump voice, a song using the real voice of Trump also charted earlier this year. A song called \"Justice for All\" features individuals imprisoned in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol singing \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" The song includes Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance as the background track. \u201cJustice for All\u201d previously hit the #1 spot on the iTunes chart, knocking Miley Cyrus from the top position. The use of artificial intelligence mimicking real musicians has been a controversial topic, with a song that portrayed Drake and The Weeknd being shut down after going viral. Musician Grimes has flipped the script and encouraged people to use her voice in AI collaborations.

                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares have experienced a rebound this year, although their performance has lagged behind other mega-cap tech companies. The stock saw a rally on Wednesday, prompted by the announcement of the iPhone 15 launch date and\u00a0the broader market\u2019s strength, influenced by hopes of rate cuts. A Diverse Portfolio: The increase in Apple\u2019s stock value signifies the recognition that the company\u2019s influence extends beyond being solely a handset manufacturer, noted CNBC Mad Money host\u00a0Jim Cramer\u00a0in a recent post on X, previously known as Twitter.\u00a0 \u201cThe people who sold Apple into the big decline will not be able to get back in,\u201d the stock picker said. \u201cThey simply don't understand the power of the stock.. and the franchise value.\u201d This skepticism, Cramer believes, originates from the perception that Apple is merely a producer of handsets. It happened again. The people who sold Apple into the big decline will not be able to get back in. They simply don't understand the power of the stock\u2026 and the franchise value. they think it is just a handset company See Also:\u00a0Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock In another post, Cramer addressed a dissatisfied Apple user\u2019s concerns about the iPhone. The user voiced disappointment about upgrading from an iPhone 8 to an iPhone 14 and finding the newer version priced much higher for seemingly identical features.\u00a0 Cramer\u2019s response was, \u201cCan I suggest that you get a 23-year-old to sit down with you and teach you how to use the 14 because if you think they are even remotely the same I have a Princess phone in my garage that I can give you so you can feel more comfortable.\u201d Why It Matters: Cramer\u2019s perspective aligns with\u00a0Deepwater Asset Management\u2018s Managing Partner\u00a0Gene Munster, who also considers Apple\u2019s scope to transcend hardware.\u00a0 Munster said in May, \u201cOver the next five years, I anticipate investors will increasingly view Apple as an essential consumer staple, akin to indispensable daily products.\u201d\u00a0 This sentiment, according to Munster, is driven by optimism around Apple\u2019s active device installation base. The company reported surpassing 2 billion active devices during its third-quarter earnings call in August, indicating ongoing growth. This robust foundation positions Apple for further ecosystem expansion. Price Action: On Wednesday, Apple\u2019s stock closed 1.92% higher at $187.65, according to\u00a0Benzinga Pro data.

                "title": "Google Pixel 8 Vs Pixel 7: Six Changes That Make Pixel 8 Worth The Wait",
                "body": "Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is all set to launch the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro on October 4. With the Pixel 8 launch date nearing, it has led to an increase in the usual debate of whether upgrading to Google's upcoming smartphone makes sense. If you are also confused by the Pixel 8 vs. Pixel 7 debate, read on to find out what you should do. What Happened: Google is all set to launch the Pixel 8 Pro and the more affordable Pixel 8 at an Oct. 4 event in New York City. Most of the focus is on the \u2018Pro' model, and this time, Google seems to be packing some important upgrades. See Also: Google Announces Oct. 4 Event: Pixel 8 Series, Pixel Watch 2 Expected To Launch Google has had a hard time keeping information about its upcoming hardware launches a secret, relatively speaking. As such, we know quite a bit about the Pixel 8 series weeks ahead of its launch. Read on to find out the winner of the Pixel 8 vs Pixel 7 argument. Google started using custom-designed chipsets in its Pixel smartphones in 2021 with the Pixel 6. In line with this, the Pixel 8 series will be powered by the Tensor G3 chipset, an update to the Tensor G2 chipset that powered the Pixel 7 series. Amongst the biggest upgrades in store for the Tensor G3 include a major graphics boost \u2013 rumors suggest that we could see a 10-core GPU. The Tensor G3 chipset is also expected to include support for 8K video recording at 30 frames per second and up to a 60% boost for camera and speech tasks. The new chipset is also said to include UFS 4.0 support \u2013 if Google uses this storage technology, it should improve across-the-board speed. Google is expected to use a new 50MP ultrawide angle camera sensor in the Pixel 8 series, up from the 12MP resolution of the Pixel 7 series. Additionally, the primary sensor is also going to be upgraded to Samsung GN2 from GN1, which can capture up to 35% more light, resulting in sharper and more detailed images. Besides this, Google also inadvertently leaked the first official image of the Pixel 8 Pro, showing off a unified camera visor design instead of splitting off the depth sensor like on the Pixel 7. In a bid to catch up to rival Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and also to make up for being left behind by Samsung, Google is reportedly going to offer up to five years of software updates. This means that Google will increase the software update support for the Pixel 8 series by two years \u2013 Pixel 8 users can expect software updates for five years from the date of launch, as against only three years on the Pixel 7 series and earlier. For comparison, Apple's five-year support for iPhones has been legendary in the smartphone industry. More recently, Apple issued an iOS update for the iPhone 5s ten years after its launch in 2013. Google is expanding its beloved photo editing tools to videos this year \u2013 reports suggest that the company is readying the feature for the Pixel 8 series based on code found in the Google Photos app. As the name suggests, Video Unblur will allow users to sharpen their videos with assistance from machine learning. The Photos app gained the Photo Unblur feature last year with the launch of the Pixel 7 series. One of the prominent complaints about the Pixel 7 has been its lower refresh rate, especially when other competing devices offer a 120Hz refresh rate. Google is expected to address that with the Pixel 8 this year \u2013 it is said to get a display with a 120Hz refresh rate, bringing it up to par with its \u2018Pro' sibling and other competing devices. It would also help Google distinguish the Pixel 8 from the Pixel 7a, which also has a display with a 90Hz refresh rate. Battery life hasn't been stellar on Pixel phones, but we could see some improvements this year with the Pixel 8 series. The Pixel 8 is expected to see a 5% higher battery capacity than the Pixel 7. It is also expected to support faster 24W wired charging compared to Pixel 7's 20W support. On the other hand, the Pixel 8 Pro is expected to see only a minor uptick in battery capacity over the Pixel 7 Pro, but wired charging speeds could see a boost to 27W from 23W.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is \ud83d\udd12.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0 The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0 If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0 Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to cease customer support on Twitter and YouTube later this year. According to MacRumors, from October 1, the @AppleSupport account on Twitter will no longer provide human replies to customer inquiries. Instead, an automated message will prompt users to contact Apple through other means. Apple also intends to stop offering technical support via comments on its YouTube Support channel. The paid Community Specialist role for the Apple Support Community forum will also be discontinued. See Also: Elon Musk Takes On Facebook: \u2018Manipulating Public Almost Everywhere On Earth\u2019 The tech giant is offering affected employees the chance to transition to phone-based support roles. However, some advisors are unable or unwilling to switch roles, causing dismay among the social media team. Training for phone support will be provided, with the transition expected to be completed by November. Those who reject phone support roles will need to seek employment outside Apple. Apple has been offering Twitter (now X) based customer support since 2016. The company justified the change, citing a customer preference for phone-based support. Apple hasn\u2019t yet commented on the reports. Image Credits \u2013 Shutterstock Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

                "body": "Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was trading slightly higher Thursday, helping to lead the S&P 500 north after Personal Consumption Expenditures data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed the economy is softening, leading to hope the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady next month. The tech giant\u2019s move higher saw it trade within an upper gap above the 50-day simple moving average, as the stock continued in a strong uptrend. An uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart. The higher highs indicate the bulls are in control while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend, with rising lower time frame moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend. Rising longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicate a long-term uptrend. Apple may find resistance at the top of the upper gap, which could set the stock into a retracement. If that happens, volatility in the stock market is likely to increase. Traders wishing to play the potential volatility in the stock market can use MIAX\u2019s SPIKES Volatility products. The products, which are traded on SPIKES Volatility Index (XMIO: SPIKE), track expected volatility in the SPY over the next 30 days. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge!

                "title": "If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin When The First Bitcoin ETF Was Filed, Here Are Your Gains Vs. Tesla, Apple",
                "body": "The long journey to have Bitcoin ETFs available to U.S. traders could be nearing an end date with a recent ruling against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for previously rejecting an ETF conversion. Here\u2019s a look at the early history of Bitcoin ETF proposals and how investors could have cashed in\u00a0if they invested when the first fund was proposed. What Happened: On Tuesday, a federal court ruled against the SEC for rejecting a request from Grayscale Investments to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) into an ETF. The order from the court doesn\u2019t guarantee the closed-end fund will become an ETF, but directs the SEC to review the application from Grayscale. \u201cThe Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale\u2019s proposed bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products, is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale\u2019s petition for review and vacate the Commission\u2019s order,\u201d said the ruling. The decision from the court could expedite the approval of several Bitcoin ETFs that have been filed and await approval. Bitcoin ETFs have been filed by the likes of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), WisdomTree (NYSE:WT), Invesco, Valkyrie Investments, Ark Invest, VanEck and Fidelity. Join Benzinga\u2019s Future of Digital Assets in NYC on Nov. 14, 2023 to hear from Grayscale Investments\u2019 Vice President Client Team Brooke Stoddard. Secure early bird discounted tickets now! Before the recent Bitcoin ETFs were filed or the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was launched in September 2013, there was an S-1 filed for a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC. On July 1, 2013, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust as a planned Bitcoin ETF. The Winkelvoss twins saw their initial filing and a second attempt rejected in 2018. The Winklevoss twins are the founders of Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange, and known as two of the largest Bitcoin proponents worldwide. Cameron Winklevoss commented on the status of Bitcoin ETFs on the 10-year anniversary of the filing, which happened last month. \u201cThe SEC\u2019s refusal to approve these products for a decade has been a complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator,\u201d Winklevoss wrote. Winklevoss accused the SEC of helping to push investors into FTX, which eventually went bankrupt and was \u201cone of the largest financial frauds in modern history.\u201d The Gemini co-founder wished luck to all the companies fighting to bring Bitcoin ETFs to market. In light of the recent court decision on Grayscale, experts are increasingly convinced that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs is now a question of 'when,' not 'if.' This shift in sentiment comes a decade after the initial filing for a Bitcoin ETF. If investors chose to buy Bitcoin at that time, they would have enjoyed market-beating returns. Related Link: How To Buy Bitcoin\u00a0 Investing $1,000 in BTC: Bitcoin hit all-time highs of nearly $69,000 in November 2021 and has traded above $10,000 for many years. It may be surprising to some that Bitcoin traded below $100 in parts of 2013 and that year marked the first time the leading cryptocurrency hit the $1,000 level. On July 1, 2013, Bitcoin traded for around $90.80. A $1,000 investment in Bitcoin could have purchased 11.0132 BTC at the time. Based on a price of $27,150.96 at the time of writing, the $1,000 investment would be worth $299,018.95 today. This represents a hypothetical return of 29,801.9% over the last 10 years. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has delivered stronger returns than leading stocks and has outpaced the overall market. For comparison, a $1,000 investment in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500, would be worth $3,371.94 today. This represents a gain of 237.2% over the last 10 years. A $1,000 investment in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) over the same time period would be worth $33,190.53 today. This represents a hypothetical return of 3,219.1%. A $1,000 investment in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the same time period would be worth $15,382.31 today. This represents a hypothetical return of 1,438.2%. While Bitcoin may not beat the market and leading stocks by the same amounts over then next decade, there is increased optimism that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and another Bitcoin halving in 2024 could be catalysts to propel the price higher.

However, this unfortunate event took an unexpected turn, thanks to the\u00a0clever deployment of an AirTag. After realizing their car had been stolen, the victim quickly informed the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department about the situation. The key detail that set this case apart was the presence of an AirTag secretly tucked away inside the stolen Dodge Charger Scat Pack,\u00a0according\u00a0to local news outlet WSMV4. See Also:\u00a0How To Clean AirPods Without Damaging Them: Remove Ear Wax And Dirt Easily The police swiftly initiated their pursuit and collaborated with the Metropolitan Nashville Aviation Unit, which\u00a0used the AirTag\u2019s signal\u00a0to track the vehicle\u2019s movement across the city. The stolen car eventually made an unexpected stop at a local barbershop, where the suspected car thief, identified as Kevonta Brooks, and a passenger entered the establishment.\u00a0 Seizing the moment, a police air unit provided a detailed description of Brooks, enabling ground units to move in and take him into custody. Upon his apprehension, authorities discovered Brooks possessed incriminating evidence, including a vehicle key FOB, a vehicle reprogramming device, and a screwdriver, all stashed in a brown backpack. The suspect now faces a slew of charges, including vehicle theft and unauthorized use of a vehicle, the report noted.\u00a0 Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0After its release in 2021, Apple\u2019s AirTag quickly gained popularity as a device meant to assist users in\u00a0finding their personal items.\u00a0 Just last month, this tiny technological marvel helped a Dutch cyclist reclaim her\u00a0stolen bicycle within an hour.\u00a0 However, AirTag has also faced criticism regarding its potential misuse by stalkers, who could exploit the device\u2019s tracking capabilities to monitor unsuspecting individuals\u00a0without their knowledge.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has for the first time explained why it abandoned plans to scan iPhones for child sexual abuse material (CSAM), underlining the importance of privacy and the \"unintended consequences\" of CSAM detection that it had planned to roll out back in 2021. What Happened: Apple has given a detailed response to justify its decision to abandon iPhone CSAM detection plans, after child safety group Heat Initiative said it would campaign against Apple's decision. See Also: Google Pixel 8 Vs Pixel 7: Six Changes That Make Pixel 8 Worth The Wait \"Scanning every user\u2019s privately stored iCloud data would create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit. It would also inject the potential for a slippery slope of unintended consequences,\" Erik Neuenschwander, Apple\u2019s director of user privacy and child safety told Wired. It's rare for Apple to issue a detailed response to third-party questions, but it only further shows how important this is for the company. Back when Apple announced its iPhone CSAM detection plans, cybersecurity and privacy experts criticized it, saying that it would harm user privacy. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, called it opening a \"backdoor\" to the private lives of users. After facing immense backlash, Apple quietly pulled references to CSAM detection on its website and subsequently called it off entirely in 2022. Apple's initial approach to CSAM detection would have violated user privacy and also introduced new vectors for malicious parties to attack. This is why the company decided to abandon the plan, according to Neuenschwander. Instead, Apple has come up with a different solution with on-device CSAM detection within apps themselves \u2013 for example, apps like Messages, FaceTime, AirDrop, and more have on-device nudity detection systems.  Apple has also launched an application programming interface (API) for this so third-party apps can implement it without adversely impacting user privacy. Apple says its approach now is to direct victims to law enforcement and other local resources, instead of acting as an intermediary. \u00a0Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has sent the 2017 MacBook Pro to the purgatory after years of macOS updates. As a result, it won't receive the upcoming macOS Sonoma update, scheduled to be launched at the September 12 event. What Happened: The 2017 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has now been assigned the \"vintage product\" tag by Apple, which means it will no longer receive macOS updates, according to the company's product service page. See Also: Apple Reveals Why It Ditched Plans To Scan iPhones For Child Sexual Abuse Material: \u2018Slippery Slope Of Unintended Consequences\u2018 This comes just days ahead of the September 12 event, and the expected launch of M3-powered MacBooks later this year. Apple usually considers five-year-old products as \"vintage\" \u2013 this essentially means users should not expect major software updates or guaranteed availability of spare parts. While Apple usually supports its products for a relatively long time, MacBooks don't get updates for as long as many Windows products do. Still, the 2017 MacBook is six years old now, so it might not affect as many users. These MacBooks will still be functional, though, so users don't really have to abandon them just yet. Why Is It Important: The issue with the 2017 MacBook Pro is its keyboard \u2013 Apple introduced the \u2018Butterfly' keyboard on MacBooks in 2015, and the 2017 MacBook Pro uses it, too. After numerous reports of these keyboards malfunctioning, Apple acknowledged the issue and recalled the faulty units. However, now that the 2017 MacBook Pro has been given the \"vintage\" tag, if you have this MacBook and the keyboard develops a problem, Apple's authorized service centers may not have the spare parts available to service it. You will also have to keep in mind that the MacBook is now out of the warranty period as well. On a positive note, though, Apple has only accorded it the \"vintage\" status, not \"obsolete\" \u2013 obsolete products are ineligible for any type of repair, while those called vintage might qualify for repairs depending on the availability of spare parts. \u00a0Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly considering using a new technology that will make the iPhone 16's display brighter and more efficient at the same time. What Happened: Apple's display suppliers, Samsung and LG, have offered to apply a technology called micro-lens arrays (MLA) to the OLED panels of next year's iPhone 16, reported The Elec. See Also: This MacBook Pro Model Is Now A \u2018Vintage Product\u2019 That Will No Longer Get OS Updates Apple is currently weighing the pros and cons of using the new technology, which involves using billions of lenses inside the OLED panels to reduce reflections. The end result is that this either allows the device to increase the brightness whilst maintaining the power consumption levels, or maintain the same brightness whilst reducing the power consumption. Samsung already has experience with applying the MLA technology on OLED displays \u2013 branded as the \"Eco\" OLED technology, Samsung has used it in the Galaxy S22 Ultra and Galaxy S23 Ultra, as well as its foldable smartphones. LG, on the other hand, has used the MLA technology on its large-sized OLED panels for TVs. These Hurdles Could Stop Apple: There are two hurdles that could prevent Apple from going ahead with the MLA technology. The first problem is that the technology could reduce the display's field of view, resulting in degrading the user experience. As far as Apple is concerned, this could prove to be too big a hurdle to clear. The second issue here is the increase in manufacturing costs. Apple is expected to hike the prices of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max this year. If it goes ahead with using the technology, it might have to absorb the increase in manufacturing costs. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 in September 2024, with mass production expected to begin in the second half of 2024. It remains to be seen if Apple is able to cross these two hurdles and use the MLA technology, or if manages to improve the efficiency of existing technology enough to skip it. \u00a0Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

If momentum continues, we could see levels of 454.56 and 455.14. Our optimistic target for SPY today is 455.90. Should the 452.55 level fail to hold, we anticipate a downward move towards 451.61 and 451.01. If selling persists, the 450.23 level could be tested. A significant sell-off could drive the price down to our support level of 449.42, with a bearish day-end target of 447.94. QQQ\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) is hovering around our key level of 378.93. For a bullish scenario, we're looking for an initial surge to 380.41. A break above this level on strong buying could lead to 381.89 and potentially 382.93. Our high target for bullish action today is 384.36. If sellers dominate, we expect a decline to our support level at 377.58. A failure to maintain above this level could see further downside to 375.98 and 375.18. A breach of 375.18 could lead to a test of 373.82, with a bearish target for the day at 372.91.

Persistent selling could drive the price down to 187.50, and a break below this could lead to our bearish day-end target of 186.99. Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading around our key level of 139.37. For the bulls, we're looking for this level to hold and a breakout towards 140.52. Sustained bullish activity could take us to our high target of 141.42. If 139.37 fails to hold, we expect a decline to 138.76. Further selling could push the price to 138.03, and a breach here could lead to our bearish target for the day at 137.22. Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is trading above our key level of 136.29. For bullish action, we're targeting a move to 137.79. If momentum continues, our high target for the day is 138.39. If the 136.29 level can't be maintained, we're looking at a potential decline to 134.96. Continued selling could take us to 133.78, and a break below this could lead to our bearish day-end target of 132.84. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently above our key level of 328.52. For the bulls, we're looking for this to hold and a rally towards 331.24. Sustained bullish momentum could take us to 333.46, with a high target for the day at 335.98.

NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading below our key level of 495.79. For a bullish scenario, we're looking for a reclaim of this level and a rally towards 500.00. If this level holds, our high target for the day is 506.40. If 495.79 can't be reclaimed, we're looking at a potential decline to 489.04.

Trademark Settlement with USPTO:\u00a0 Apple has reached a settlement with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) over its \"Smart Keyboard\" trademark application.\u00a0 The conflict began in 2018 when the PTO rejected Apple's application, a decision upheld by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in 2021.\u00a0 Apple contested the ruling, arguing that \"Smart Keyboard\" was a unique trade name for its iPad accessory. The specifics of the settlement remain undisclosed.\u00a0More details here. iPhone 15 Release Date Announced:\u00a0 Apple has officially revealed that the iPhone 15 will be launched on September 12, with the event taking place in California.\u00a0 The upcoming range will feature both entry-level and premium models.

                "body": "Elon Musk is testing a new feature on X (previously Twitter) that allows creators to retain and directly communicate with their subscribers, promoting platform flexibility and addressing concerns of content creators feeling \"trapped.\" Elon Musk\u00a0appears to be actively working to fulfill his promise of giving creators the freedom to retain their audience even if they choose to leave\u00a0X, formerly known as\u00a0Twitter. What Happened:\u00a0Almost\u00a0two months after Musk first announced\u00a0that X would provide subscribers\u2019 email addresses (who opt-in) to content creators, reports surfaced that the feature is in actual testing.\u00a0 Apart from its highlighted purpose of eliminating concerns about being trapped on one platform, the feature also aims to facilitate direct communication between creators and their subscribers.\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0Elon Musk Flexes\u2019 Truth In Advertising\u2019 On X Versus Instagram\u2019s Unchecked Sponsored Posts The tech billionaire has also publicly endorsed this move, highlighting the importance of creators having the flexibility to take their subscribers with them when they leave the platform.\u00a0 It's vital that creators be able to leave our platform at any time and take their subscribers with them.\n\r\nWe want to give peace of mind to creators that they're not trapped here if they build a large audience. https://t.co/K2HEzQ1LUw Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0While Musk appears to be making X a creator-friendly place, many users continue complaining about their Subscription application still \u201cpending.\u201d\u00a0 Yeah that's great but we still haven't had anyone unlock subscriptions for the past 4 months. My application is still \"pending\" According to an account on the platform, the reason behind this hold is that creator subscriptions need to be approved by\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) and\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) app stores. In contrast, ad revenue payouts are much easier because they only go through\u00a0Stripe.\u00a0 While the reasoning made sense to some users, others questioned that X could fast-track web-only Subscribe buttons.   Oh, makes sense now. Tons of creators are waiting on Subscriptions, but I never realized Apple and Google have to sign off because of in-app purchases.\n\r\nBut X could (& should) fast-track Web-only Subscribe buttons; those could be available immediately (and no 30% cut for Apple). For the unversed, Musk rebranded the \"Super Follows\" feature on Twitter as the \"Subscriptions\" model.\u00a0The rebranded version essentially allows content\u00a0creators and influencers to use the platform and monetize their presence by offering unique content to their subscribers.\u00a0  Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Benzinga\u00a0examined the prospects for many investors'\u00a0favorite stocks over the last week \u2014 here's a look at some of our top stories. The Dow Jones and the Nasdaq Composite had their best weeks since July, with increases of 1.4% and 3.3% respectively, while the S&P 500 saw its highest weekly gain since June at 2.5%. This performance came as the U.S. economy experienced some fluctuating indicators. Unemployment in the U.S. rose slightly to 3.8% in August, its peak in over a year, defying economists' forecasts that it would hold at 3.5%. Concurrently, the Federal Reserve's favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, rose 3.3% YoY in July, aligning with experts' estimates, and August job growth surpassed expectations with 187,000 new non-farm jobs, despite a drop in job openings to 8.8 million. Benzinga provides daily reports on\u00a0the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look. \"Exclusive: Watch Cathie Wood Predict SEC's Loss In Bitcoin ETF Case In Benzinga Interview,\" by Chris Katje, discusses Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood's prediction that the SEC will lose its case against Grayscale Investments, potentially paving the way for multiple Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF approvals and driving up demand for the apex crypto. \"Dan Ives Calls August Slump 'Half-Time of a Super Bowl Rally' in Tech, Targets Nvidia,\" by Adam Eckert, discusses Wedbush analyst Dan Ives' bullish outlook on the tech sector, particularly spotlighting Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), predicting a 12% to 15% rally by year's end fueled by unprecedented growth. \"Exclusive: Michael Van de Poppe Says Dogecoin Will Skyrocket 150% If Elon Musk Integrates DOGE Into X,\" by Mehab Qureshi, highlights that crypto analyst Michael Van de Poppe predicts a 150% surge in Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) if Elon Musk integrates the cryptocurrency into his platform, X, fueling speculation and a rally in meme coins.

A closer look, however, reveals a shared attraction to businesses that control critical access points, according to Insider.\u00a0 While Buffett is drawn to the steady income of toll roads, Musk reportedly zeroes in on bottlenecks. Buffett has always been intrigued by the concept of charging for access, the outlet noted. From his early days, he saw the potential in monopolistic ventures, including\u00a0as the sole newspaper provider in\u00a0town. While observing a continuous stream of cars passing a friend's home, the billionaire investor\u00a0once remarked, \"All that traffic ...\u00a0what a shame you aren't making money from the people going by,\"\u00a0according to \"Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist\" by Roger Lowenstein. Buffett \"likens owning a monopoly or market-dominant newspaper to owning an unregulated toll bridge,\"\u00a0Sandy Gottesman, one of Buffett's friends and a former Berkshire director, told a newspaper at one point, according to Insider. \"You have relative freedom to increase rates when and as much as you want.\" Also Read:\u00a0Here Are The Eyebrow-Raising Moves Warren Buffett, Michael Burry And Bill Ackman Made Recently One standout example of Buffett's strategy is his investment in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple's robust brand and its grip on the App Store have positioned it as a digital toll booth, with the capability to increment prices annually. Conversely, Musk is laser-focused on managing bottlenecks. He identifies pivotal constraints in sectors and then channels resources to address them, Insider noted.\u00a0 For instance, the Tesla CEO\u00a0discerned that battery limitations were hampering electric vehicles. By pouring investments into battery innovation, he fortified Tesla's competitive stance. Musk's forays into EV charging infrastructures, SpaceX's rocketry\u00a0and the Starlink communication platform all underscore his intent to govern essential industry access points.

                "body": "In an ambitious move, Arm Holdings Ltd, a leading chip designer under the banner of SoftBank Group Corp (OTC:SFTBY), is setting the stage for its initial public offering (IPO) next week. What Happened: The company\u00a0hinted at a share price bracket of $47 to $51, insiders revealed to Reuters. Such a pricing strategy could catapult Arm to a valuation ranging from $50 billion to $54 billion and\u00a0an offering of\u00a0$5 billion to $5.4 billion. It would also crown Arm as the most prized company to grace the New York stock exchange since Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) in 2021, Reuters reported. SoftBank is reportedly considering nudging the\u00a0price range a notch higher if the market shows an insatiable appetite. Both Arm and SoftBank, however, have opted to keep their cards close to their chest, refraining from making any official statements. The valuation that Arm is currently eyeing is somewhat toned down from the staggering $64 billion at which SoftBank recently acquired\u00a0its 25% stake\u00a0in the firm, Reuters\u00a0noted.\u00a0 Also Read:\u00a0SoftBank-Backed Arm Eyes Commercial Blockbuster Products Ahead Of IPO, Shelves Flagship Division The adjustment\u00a0seems to stem from a waning demand for a few of Arm's products.

                "body": "Apple confirmed last week that it will hold its iPhone launch event on Sept. 12, and expectations concerning the next iteration of the iPhone continue to build up. What Happened: Apple has been forced to embrace the USB-C connector for all variants of its iPhone 15 and the AirPods Pro, despite the company's dislike for the connector, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said in the latest installment of the weekly \u201cPower On\u201d newsletter on Sunday. The switchover was necessitated by the European Union's mandate that mobile device makers should transition to the USB-C standard by the end of the year. Despite its lack of enthusiasm for the connector, Apple will likely tout a slew of advantages, including the use of single-charging cables for iPhones, Macs and iPads; breakthrough data transfer speed; faster charging; and the compatibility of the iPhone with chargers used by non-Apple devices, the Apple writer said. The company always wants to operate from a position of strength when it introduces a new product or deals with the media, Gurman said. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock Drawbacks To Change: Gurman said he foresees some drawbacks as Apple transitions to USB-C technology. These include: Gurman said Apple will do its best to mitigate the concerns.  \u201cIt will include a USB-C cable in the box, and it's been pushing MagSafe and other forms of inductive charging for several years,\u201d  he said. The company can also ensure \u201cthere are plenty of adapters that convert Lightning to USB-C, helping [to] make the transition as seamless as possible,\u201d he added. However, the Apple writer said he sees one unavoidable headache. \u201cEven if Apple includes a USB-C cord with every new iPhone, users will need a compatible charging brick. And that's unlikely to be part of the package,\u201d he said. Anyone currently using a charger sold with an iPhone 11 or earlier model will need to buy a new brick that has a USB-C port or buy a cable that converts USB 2 to USB-C, he added. Apple ended Friday's session up 0.85% at $189.46, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) embrace of the USB-C cable with the iPhone 15 might have been a forced decision, but users with Lightning cables might have to look for a dongle yet again. What Happened: Apple is ditching the Lightning cable with the iPhone 15 series and switching to the universal USB-C port, leaving very few products in its portfolio with its proprietary connector. See Also: iPhone 15 Launch Rumors: Thinner Bezels, Periscope Camera And Action Button, Everything We Know So Far Apple's switching to the USB-C port has muddied waters once again for its users \u2013 the company has long been criticized for forcing users to buy dongles either due to a lack of ports on its devices or the different types of ports across its product portfolio. The iPhone is Apple's crown jewel, and with the company switching to USB-C, very few products still use proprietary connectors. This could reduce Apple users' dependence on dongles going forward. Apple could also launch the AirPods with a USB-C port \u2013 this will make life easier for users since AirPods are likely to be the most used with iPhones as well as other smartphones. Surprisingly, iPads and Macs were amongst the first Apple products to switch to the USB-C port. What About Older Devices: Beyond the iPhone 15 and USB-C AirPods, there are still millions of iPhones, AirPods, and other Apple device users who will have to either use a separate Lightning cable or buy another dongle from Apple. Here's how Apple's switch to the USB-C port on iPhone 15 will impact users: iPhone: The iPhone 15 series will be the first to feature the ubiquitous USB-C port. All iPhones, beginning with the iPhone 5 launched in 2012, have the Lightning port, so most iPhone users in the world have a Lightning cable. However, Apple continues to sell older iPhones, so we will likely continue to see support for the Lightning port \u2013 both cables as well as dongles \u2013 for the foreseeable future. AirPods: Apple is expected to launch the first pair of AirPods with the USB-C port alongside the iPhone 15 series. All previous AirPods and AirPods Pro models have the Lightning port. iPad: Apple has ditched the Lightning port for good on iPads with the launch of the iPad 10th generation launched in 2022. However, the 9th generation iPad uses the Lightning port for now, and Apple is still selling it. Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad: Apple could switch to the USB-C port on its suite of accessories when it refreshes them next. For now, though, the Magic Keyboard, Mouse, and Track all use the Lightning port. EarPods: Apple switched to the Lighting connector on the EarPods with the iPhone 7 in 2016, four years after it launched the first iPhone with the Lightning port. However, with the AirPods being quite popular this time, it's unclear how long Apple will take to switch the USB-C connector on the AirPods.

This intentional delay allowed Apple extra time to refine its new app window management system, \u201cStage Manager\u201c, which faced initial skepticism during its beta testing phase. The timeliness of this year\u2019s software rollout might be associated with the upcoming iPhone 15 series. If speculations hold, iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 could be launched alongside the iPhone 15 announcement at Apple\u2019s \u201cWonderlust\u201d event on September 12. Apple will stream this fall event live. Those eager to watch the latest innovations firsthand can tune in on Apple\u2019s official website, YouTube channel, or the Apple TV app. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone safety feature is set to receive a boost from an unexpected ally, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. The two companies are joining forces to enhance the Emergency SOS capabilities of Apple\u2019s latest smartphones. What happened: According to a report by Nola, Globalstar plans to spend $64 million over the next two years to use SpaceX\u2019s satellites. In this venture, Apple\u2019s partner\u00a0Globalstar, which manages the necessary satellites for the service, plays a crucial role. Globalstar has been providing 85% of its network for Apple\u2019s use in phones and intends to continue doing so for future deals. This would give Apple a wider range of satellites for its SOS services. See Also:\u00a0Deal Alert: Get The iPad Air With M1 Chip At A $180 Discount As per the report, the partnership aims to improve the accessibility of emergency services for iPhone users, even without WiFi or cellular signal. This was initially introduced with the iPhone 14. Why is it important: Currently exclusive to the iPhone 14 line, these services are expected to be available with the upcoming iPhone 15 series. They enable users to text emergency services and share vital information and location when cell service is unavailable. Despite the high costs of establishing networks and maintaining satellites, Apple has been offering the SOS service for free for two years following\u00a0the activation of the iPhone 14\u00a0or iPhone 14 Pro.

According to\u00a0The Verge, a Korean news publication, Maeil Business Newspaper, uncovered that the tech giants are heading towards a joint venture. The new VR device could be priced around\u00a0$2,000, featuring LG displays and components from LG subsidiaries such as LG Innotek. The Korean publication also hinted at Meta\u2019s plan to roll out a budget-friendly\u00a0Quest headset next year that\u00a0might be priced under\u00a0$200. However, Meta has yet to comment on the matter. See Also:\u00a0Meta Platforms, Qualcomm And 2 Other Stocks Insiders Are Selling The rumored pricing of the forthcoming headsets seems to deviate from Meta\u2019s current pricing strategy. The Quest 2 retails for\u00a0$299, while the announced Quest 3 is set to be sold at\u00a0$499. The alleged high-end headset, rumored to be named the \u201cMeta Quest 4 Pro,\u201d would break Meta\u2019s tradition of keeping Quest and Quest Pro product numbering separate. Despite the hefty\u00a0$2,000 price tag, the new high-end Quest is believed to compete against Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0$3,499 Vision Pro headset. The Mark Zuckerberg-led company has previously ventured into co-branded products before. The Oculus Rift S\u00a0featured Lenovo branding,\u00a0the production of Oculus Go was handled by\u00a0Xiaomi, and Samsung produced the mobile Gear VR.  However, the supposed LG partnership would hold a unique position if it differentiates from these past alliances.

                "body": "Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) is amid a restructuring exercise as it faces fundamental challenges and there are rumors adrift that the company might offload its ESPN cable sports channel. An analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets weighed in on the value ESPN has for Disney. Muted Expectations: ESPN is a \u201cmelting iceberg,\u201d said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel. Its valuation could be currently at $30 billion, assuming nine times the valuation multiple of the estimated EBITDA estimate for 2024. The fair value range is at $28 billion to $36 billion, he said. The analyst estimates ESPN's revenue to be $16 billion, and expects it to have a low-single-digit revenue growth profile. Much of the growth will likely come from the direct-to-consumer business as linear revenues are tracing a downward trajectory, he said. See Also:\u00a0Best Media Diversified Stocks Assuming $10.1 billion in programming and production costs for ESPN in fiscal year 2023, ESPN's operating income margins will likely be in the low 20%, he added. \u201cWe view the value of ESPN as likely below the consensus, which is just one of the five reasons we are cautious on DIS,\u201d the analyst said. ESPN\u2019s fundamental outlook is negative and could materially worsen if Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) distribution agreement isn't renewed, Nispel said. \u201cThe opportunity for ESPN in streaming means price increases are coming, which will challenge scale,\u201d he added. Patience Is Virtue: KeyBanc said it is unlikely that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will buy ESPN. \u201cWhile some believe ESPN could be worth $50B and AAPL is likely an acquirer, we don\u2019t believe it is likely AAPL will acquire the business when valuations may be coming down in the future,\u201d it said. Patience, according to Nispel, is the best transaction strategy, given ESPN is a renter of content and rents continue to increase more quickly than Disney. 2 Near-Term Events: The analyst sees Disney re-segmenting and breaking out ESPN from Disney entertainment and the company's Investor Summit focused on Disney Parks, Experiences and Products as two notable events for Disney in the near term. \u201cWe view neither event as a positive catalyst for shares,\u201d he said. KeyBanc has a Sector Weight rating for Disney shares. Disney closed Friday's session down 2.44% at $81.64, according to\u00a0data from Benzinga Pro.

                "body": "Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) could abandon leather in favor of eco-friendly materials for its upcoming\u00a0iPhone 15\u00a0lineup cases and Watch bands, sparking questions about the potential ramifications for its coveted partnership with\u00a0luxury fashion brand\u00a0Hermes.\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0In the last week of August, prominent tech leakers who go by the name @MajinBuOfficial and @DuanRui on\u00a0Twitter, now rebranded as\u00a0X, shared images sourced from\u00a0Weibo, purportedly showcasing Apple\u2019s official leather-alternative cases for the iPhone 15.\u00a0 On Tuesday,\u00a0Mark Gurman, a respected tech insider, shared a post by\u00a0Sonny Dickson, one of the most reliable Apple leakers, fueling speculation by presenting a sample or replica of the purported leather-free iPhone 15 case.\u00a0 Gurman hinted that this shift away from leather might also extend to Apple Watch bands.\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0Apple, Microsoft Hustle To Keep iMessage, Bing Off EU\u2019s Tech\u2019 Gatekeepers\u2019 List: Report A sample/replica of the new leather-free iPhone 15 case. I am expecting Apple to begin moving away from leather on its Apple Watch bands as well, but unclear how this impacts the Hermes partnership (I would assume it does not). https://t.co/dUA36mX2BL According to Gurman,\u00a0Apple\u2019s Sept. 12 product launch\u00a0event will feature environmental sustainability as a theme. The cases shared by tech leakers are reportedly woven from eco-friendly materials and have a significantly smaller carbon footprint than traditional cowhide leather.\u00a0 Moreover, Apple last month offered its employees steep discounts of up to 90% on Hermes leather accessories, potentially signaling an inventory clearance, said Gurman, citing sources.\u00a0\u00a0 While this suggests a possible shift in strategy, the implications for the longstanding Apple-Hermes collaboration remain uncertain, although Gurman assumed that it won\u2019t have any impact.\u00a0 For instance, an Apple-Hermes band normally $850 is on sale for $85 to Apple employees (probably what it is actually worth). Several other accessories including many Solo Loop bands  in outgoing colors and the MagSafe charging dock are also on deep discount to clear stock. https://t.co/VmTElj1FcF Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0Last week, Cupertino sent out invitations for its upcoming hardware launch event on Sept. 12, where the iPhone 15 lineup is expected to be unveiled. The invite was shared on X by\u00a0Greg Joswiak, Apple\u2019s senior VP of marketing, with the caption \u201cWonder awaits\u201d and the hashtag #AppleEvent, bearing the tagline \u201cWonderlust.\u201d The event will be streamed on Apple.com and the Apple TV app. Gurman previously said that iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models could get the biggest updates since the\u00a0company added 5G capability\u00a0three years ago.

                "body": "Desktops aren't always the sleekest machines, but Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iMac patent gives us a peek into what this could look like in reality. What Happened: Apple has filed a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a foldable iMac. While it does not use a folding display, it has a folding glass panel at the bottom, giving us a picture of a refined and elegant-looking desktop. See Also: With iPhone 15 Taking USB-C Route, What Good Is Your Lightning Cable For Now? Apple has filed a patent for foldable MacBooks and is also working on a foldable iPad. While there have been murmurs of foldable iMacs before, this time is slightly different since the display itself is not foldable. Still, a sleek-looking desktop could add the zing that is missing from Apple's iMac lineup. More Than Just The Looks: It's not all about the looks either with this folding iMac patent \u2013 Apple's descriptions and drawings suggest that the company intends to make it as compact as possible, like a notebook. To achieve this, the patent describes that the front folding glass can be easily folded on the bottom, so it takes up as little space as possible. On the other hand, the keyboard and trackpad can be slid out from behind whenever you want to use the iMac and neatly wrapped up on the back when you're done with your work. Overall, Apple's drawings point at an extremely sleek, futuristic-looking iMac \u2013 even though it's not one of Apple's best sellers, the company hasn't given up on it yet. On an optimistic note, this could also spur Windows desktop makers to give their designs more thought than they do now.

                "body": "As we inch closer to the September 12 \u2018Wonderlust' launch event of Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 series, a new report suggests that Apple is being cautious and expecting lower demand compared to last year's iPhone 15 series. What Happened: Apple is likely expecting weaker demand for the iPhone 15 compared to the iPhone 14, slashing its orders by millions of units, according to a report by DigiTimes. See Also: iPhone 15 Launch Rumors: Thinner Bezels, Periscope Camera And Action Button, Everything We Know So Far Apple has reportedly placed 80-90 million orders for the iPhone 15 series for the second half of 2023, as compared to 90-100 million orders for the iPhone 14 series last year. Based on this, Apple is expecting 10 million fewer orders for the iPhone 15 series on average. Apple is also said to have shifted some orders away from Foxconn to two of its other suppliers, Luxshare and Pegatron. Foxconn remains Apple's biggest manufacturing partner, though. This aligns with previous reports by noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Sony, one of Apple's key suppliers \u2013 both sources have projected weaker demand for the iPhone 15 compared to the iPhone 14. Apple's Surprise Bet: The share of Apple's most expensive phones, the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the iPhone 15 Pro, is increasing despite an overall decrease in the order size. Earlier, Kuo said that the top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max could become the best-selling iPhone despite being the most expensive iPhone so far. One of the reasons, according to Kuo, is the major camera upgrade Apple has in store. \"It means Apple is optimistic about the selling point of the periscope, which is only available in iPhone 15 Pro Max,\" Kuo said. The iPhone 15 Pro Max will be the only iPhone 15 model to sport the new periscope camera. The upcoming iPhone flagship is expected to feature a triple camera setup on the back with the new lens system. A periscope lens system would allow Apple to achieve superior lossless zoom at levels like 5x or higher compared to a traditional system.

This move is to compete with Alphabet Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Chromebook, primarily in education sector. A report from Digitimes suggests that this cost-effective MacBook series could be launched\u00a0as early as the second\u00a0half of 2024. Apple\u2019s current least expensive MacBook\u00a0is the M1 MacBook Air\u00a0from 2020. The company is expected to carve out a separate product line for these budget-friendly MacBooks, distinctly different from the MacBook Air and Pro lines.

However, currently, there\u2019s no indication of any movement in the supply chain, implying that the cheap\u00a0MacBook is at least nine\u00a0months away. While Apple\u2019s iPad lineup currently serves as its most affordable offering to students, industry observers have noted that iPads are not as easy to use and\u00a0cannot compete with Chromebooks on\u00a0price. Thus, this low-cost MacBook may be Apple\u2019s answer to these issues. However, the market dominated by Chromebooks priced around $200 may prove challenging for Apple to penetrate.

Users must maintain an active Apple ID on the Mac, which acts as a server to relay iMessages to their Android devices.\u00a0 The catch here is that your Mac must always remain connected to the internet for this workaround to function seamlessly. A second option is an invite-only app called\u00a0Beeper.\u00a0 The app unifies all your messaging needs, including text messages, WhatsApp, and, intriguingly, iMessage.\u00a0 While this solution sounds cool, Brownlee said it also raises skepticism regarding the underlying processes, as it essentially requires users to log into their Apple ID on a remote Mac situated in some server farm.\u00a0 Therefore, whether you find this solution appealing largely hinges on your comfort level with such an arrangement. iMessage\u2026\u2026 on Android pic.twitter.com/Mgzw0xG5hL Why It\u2019s Important: Google\u00a0has been pushing hard\u00a0to make\u00a0RCS, a next-generation text messaging standard, the norm for messaging. It even pressured Apple to adopt RCS. Apple has vehemently opposed it, with CEO\u00a0Tim Cook\u00a0saying that he\u2019d \u201clove to convert\u201d\u00a0Android owners to iPhone users.\u00a0 Image Credits \u2013 Shutterstock View more tech hacks by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fought the Right to Repair movement for a long time, but now that it has folded, there is an unexpected new adversary on the horizon \u2013 Tom Cruise's cult Scientology. What Happened: Author Services, owned by a church within Scientology, has filed its opposition to the Right to Repair legislation, asking the government to make it illegal to work around the software locks on its electronic meter, reported 404media. See Also: Samsung Becomes Tesla Cars\u2019 Eyes As It Will Now Supply Camera Modules To Elon Musk\u2019s EV Company Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's organization, Author Services, sent a letter on August 10 to the US Copyright Office voicing its opposition to the Right to Repair. The organization cited the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's (DMCA) Section 1201, which \"makes it unlawful to circumvent technological measures used to prevent unauthorized access to copyrighted works.\" What Is This About: The Scientology group opposes Right to Repair because it doesn't want its customers \u2013 cult members, in this case \u2013 to circumvent the software locks on the Scientology E-Meters, or electropsychometers. According to the Church of Scientology, this E-Meter \"is an electronic instrument that measures mental state and change of state in individuals and assists the precision and speed of auditing.\" It adds that only a Scientology minister or a minister-in-training should use this E-Meter. The group justifies its opposition to Right to Repair by saying that unauthorized repairs could adversely impact the \"reputation and goodwill\" of Scientology. Why It Matters: Right to Repair will ensure end users can buy original spare parts based on their requirements. This will help make repairs easier and also make them more competitively priced, resulting in improved accessibility to everyone. More accessible repairs will also help reduce e-waste, which is another growing problem. Image \u2013 Wikimedia Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: Currently, the SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is trading below our crucial threshold of 450.23. Bulls will want to see a rally up to this level, establishing it as a support point. If that happens, we could see further upward movement to 451.01 and 451.61. The day's optimistic target for SPY is 452.55. Should the SPY fail to secure 450.23 as support, we anticipate a downward move to 449.42. If that level also fails to hold, expect a sharp sell-off down to 447.94. In the case of extreme selling, the day's bearish target is 446.31. The QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ)\u00a0is hovering around our key level of 375.98. Bulls should aim for an initial surge to 377.58. Sustained buying above this level could propel the price to 378.93, with an ultimate bullish target of 380.41 for the day. If sellers dominate, we expect a test of the 375.98 support level. A failure to maintain above this could trigger a bearish move to 375.18, and potentially down to 373.82. The day's lowest bearish target is 372.91. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading above our set level of 187.50. For bullish action, this level should serve as support, with potential rallies to 188.05 and 188.32. The day's high target for Apple is 189.16. If 187.50 fails as support, look for a dip to 186.99. Further selling could push the price down to 186.35, and if that level breaks, the bearish target for the day is 185.86. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading above our key level of 328.52. Bulls will want this level to hold as support, aiming for a rally to 331.24 and potentially 333.46. The day's high target for Microsoft is 335.98. If 328.52 can't hold, expect a bearish move to 326.05. Further declines could take us to 324.81, with a day's low target of 323.17. Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading near our key level of 137.22. Bulls should aim for this level to hold as support, targeting a move to 138.03 and possibly 138.76. If 137.22 fails to hold, anticipate a sharp sell-off to 135.97, and potentially down to 135.39.

Bulls should aim for this level to hold as support, with an upward target of 483.43 and potentially 489.04. The day's high target for NVIDIA is 495.79.

                "title": "Dell Becomes One Of The Early Generative AI Winners",
                "body": "Last week, Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) had its best stock market day since its 2018 return to the public market after it reported its fiscal second quarter results. Despite a revenue decline, Morgan Stanley named the computer maker as its top hardware pick, dethroning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as Dell emerged as an early winner of the Generative AI momentum. While HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) lost its ground on soft guidance with its shares falling 6.6% upon the report on Tuesday, Dell shares\u00a0surged 21.3% on Friday.\u00a0Salesforce (NYSE:\u00a0CRM)\u00a0also provided some much-needed good news for the tech sector with its shares rising 3% on Thursday after the software giant lifted the annual guidance and topped Q2 estimates, guiding for improved demand for the second half of the year. The maker of IT hardware and infrastructure technology\u00a0reported a\u00a013%\u00a0YoY revenue drop\u00a0to $22.9 billion,\u00a0but still exceeding\u00a0$20.9 billion\u00a0that was\u00a0Refinitiv\u2019s consensus estimate. The servers and networking brought in $4.27 billion, as they rose 11% from the previous quarter on the back of rising demand for AI-optimized servers that Dell effectively capitalized on.\u00a0Adjusted earnings per share\u00a0amounted to\u00a0$1.74\u00a0and also\u00a0exceeded the $1.14\u00a0consensus estimate. Dell\u00a0raised its full-year forecasts for both revenue and profit, providing hope of a potential end of the tech spending downturn.\u00a0 For the undergoing third quarter, Dell projected a revenue range from $22.5 billion to $23.5 billion, topping Refinitiv\u2019s estimate of $21.67 billion. Dell guided for earnings per share of about $1.45, surpassing the estimated $1.38. For the full year, Dell lifted its projections for revenue that is now expected in the range between $89.5 billion to $91.5 billion with EPS of $6.30, up or down 20 cents. Dell\u2019s full year outlook shows its confidence in sustainable growth. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) undoubtedly provided the most impressive Q2 report as its second sales revenue doubled to\u00a0$13.51 billion, eclipsing Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimate of $11.22 billion\u00a0thanks to skyrocketing demand for AI chips. Through its collaboration with Nvidia that was launched in May through Project Helix, Dell got the opportunity for exposure to this smashing success. The partnership with Nvidia, through which the two companies aim to empower businesses to utilize generative AI, has the potential to strengthen Dell\u2019s positioning and boost its financial performance. Unlike HP that provided a weaker than expected guidance and PC demand backdrop, Dell provided signs of life for the PC universe.\u00a0Its latest report quarter shows that Dell has undoubtedly\u00a0benefited from a stabilizing market for computer hardware and server products and that it capitalized on the surging demand for generative artificial intelligence solutions. As the global technology landscape continues to evolve, Dell\u2019s strong results provide a glimmer of hope of a potential rebound in tech spending.\u00a0 DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

                "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Cathie Wood Breaks Down $2,000 Tesla Price Target With Benzinga",
                "body": "One of the biggest believers in the growth of electric vehicle leader Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) over the years has been Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood. In 2018, Wood called out a huge\u00a0future price target for Tesla that was laughed at \u2014\u00a0but the stock reached the level\u00a0earlier than she said. Here\u2019s what Wood thinks about Tesla\u2019s future valuation. What Happened: In April, Ark Invest shared an updated price target of $2,000 for Tesla shares. In a recent interview on \"The Raz Report\"\u00a0with Benzinga CEO Jason Raznick, Wood stood behind her $2,000 price target and may have hinted at a future increase.\u00a0 \u201cOur price target for 2027 is $2,000, that\u2019s what we\u2019re in print on,\u201d Wood said. \u201cOur confidence in autonomous has gone up, so you can conclude what you want with that.\u201d Tesla's technology and FSD have improved, and Ark is impressed with the software upgrades it has seen, she said.\u00a0 The Ark Invest CEO answered questions on callouts from investors asking why the company\u2019s ETFs have sold Tesla shares despite being so bullish for the future. Ark is always looking for times to take profits and move funds to other companies, Wood said.\u00a0The CEO mentioned eVTOL company Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) as an example. Ark expects a higher compounded annual growth rate from Archer than Tesla, but the stock is more speculative, she said.\u00a0 Ark is able to source liquidity from onestock that has a good run and source it to another, Wood said. \u201cWe\u2019re very opportunistic.\u201d Ark will take profits on a stock if it has gone up over a short period of time and the profits can be allocated to another high-conviction trade idea that might have seen shares suffer a short-term pullback, she told Raznick.\u00a0 Related Link: Exclusive: Is Nvidia Overvalued? Cathie Wood Says Every Stock Could Become An AI Stock\u00a0 Why It\u2019s Important: Wood is\u00a0one of the most widely followed investors of the last five years. Some of the notoriety could be attributed to Wood\u2019s famous call for Tesla shares to hit $4,000\u00a0back in 2018. The call came at a time when Tesla shares were trading around $350 and the highest price target from analysts was $500. \u201cIf we\u2019re right, this stock in our models is going to $4,000. If we\u2019re wrong and all they do is electric, our bear case is $600,\u201d Wood said in 2018. Three years later, Tesla shares hit Wood\u2019s $4,000 price target when\u00a0adjusted for a stock split. Over the last several years, Ark Invest has shared several price targets for Tesla shares, factoring in items like full self-driving and robotaxis. A model previously laid out a price target of $500 by 2026. The new price targets from April call for a base of $2,000 in 2027 with a bear case of $1,400 and a bull case of $2,500. Wood told Raznick that analysts and investors may be getting part of the Tesla trade wrong if they\u2019re valuing the company only as an automotive stock.\u00a0 \u201cTesla, because of its positioning with AI, it is the only auto company or tech company that has designed its own chip for autonomous driving,\u201d Wood said. Wood compared\u00a0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Tesla and its decision to make its own chip. \u201cIt has taken a leaf from Apple\u2019s book. Apple redefined the cell phone market by designing a chip that turned the cell phone into a computer.\u201d Tesla having its own chips and pushing into autonomous vehicles is important for the company\u2019s future valuation, she said.\u00a0 \u201cThis is not an auto play. This is an autonomous taxi platform play with software as-a-service like margins,\u201d Wood said. Tesla is the largest holding in both the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) and Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARRQ), representing 10.9% and 13.6% of assets, respectively. Tesla is the fourth-largest holding in the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF(NYSE:ARKW), representing 6.6% of assets. Read Next: Is Cathie Wood The Next Warren Buffett?

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is range bound.\u00a0 Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is \ud83d\udd12.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0 Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "body": "A recently leaked video unmistakably highlights the introduction of an Action button in the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro, replacing the traditional mute switch. According to\u00a0Apple Insider, the video was shared by reliable leaker Sonny Dickson. Despite the absence of detailed commentary, the casing shown in the video makes clear the presence of the Action button, located above the volume controls.

                "body": "Last week's candle reached into a bearish imbalance, right at the 70% retracement of the current swing range and rejected. Bulls will need a close above that level for another upside push towards the swing high at 4638.   NQ ran into the weekly bearish order block at 15556, rejected and close below. I am expecting a pullback into the discount bullish imbalance, preferably in the 62-79% range.  DXY with a strong close to the week, closing above the bearish imbalance dating back to February for the first time after multiple attempts. Liquidity at 104.69 and 105.88. If DXY can reach there, that should be enough to pull back the indices.  Still no daily close over the bearish imbalance from early August. IF this is the high, I'd like to see price head for a lower imbalance, preferably in the golden pocket 62-79% range.  Like ES, I am looking for the same type of move, preferably 15000 before an end of year run on the highs. Taking out 14609 would put an end to my bullish end of year thought.  Nothing too convincing on the SPY (NYSE:SPY) 30m just yet. Price has been range bound over the last few days. Will wait on an imbalance to form and proceed from there.  (NASDAQ:AAPL) - Stronger than most, used previous resistance as support and continued to run higher to close out last week. 2 levels of interest at 189.92 and 188.28.  (NASDAQ:TSLA) - On a larger view, the aggressive sell off turned out to bring price right to the 79% level, where price bounced to end the day. 3 levels of resistance overhead.  (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - Bearish market structure shift on Friday and chop to close the week. One large bearish imbalance in the golden pocket starting just above 136.  (NASDAQ:AMZN) - Bearish market structure shift Friday, before retracing into premium and rejecting. If bearish, I'd expect 134 to get hit this week.  (NASDAQ:MRNA) - 79% retracement and hold to finish the week. Highs at 119 still have yet to have been swept.  (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Bearish market structure shift on a smaller time window Friday, creating a large bearish imbalance from 490.94 to 497. I'd want a retracement to that level and rejection lower, down towards 470.

The chip design firm expects to offer shares for $47 to $51 and\u00a0raise approximately $5\u00a0billion in its initial offering, per a new regulatory filing with the SEC.\u00a0 Softbank is expected to beneficially own approximately 90.6% of the company's\u00a0outstanding\u00a0shares following Arm's public debut.

                "body": "NFP: The latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report\u00a0showed the unemployment rate ticked higher to 3.8% in August, reaching its highest level in more than a year. Economists had expected it to remain at 3.5%. In another sign of a slowing economy and easing pricing pressures, average hourly earnings increased 4.3% on a year-over-year basis, less than the 4.4% increase expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. August payrolls grew at a faster-than-expected pace, with 187,000 being added. However, job numbers first reported for June and July were revised down by a combined 110,000. JOLTs: The number of job openings edged down to 8.8 million in July,\u00a0dropping from 9.58 million in June, reported the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in its monthly\u00a0Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.\u00a0Quits also declined 3.5 million, while layoffs and discharges slightly fell to 1.6 million. We refer back to this SPDR S&P 500 (NASDAQ:SPY)\u00a0chart that we\u2019ve been tracking since beginning of the year. $SPY 4HTF. Initially our \u201cLOW\u201d call, was 440/443 range which was the breakout area in July, which should have turned support. We know that this range was held for about 4 days back in August but finally did break down and hit 434 at August 18th lows. For now, we remain steadfast that the lows experienced on August 18, was the bottom. While we backtested late August to test the lows, velocity we saw this week back above 443 and beyond is quite convincing that investors are buying the dips.\u00a0  There are a few reasons we feel this was the low and we are about to test new yearly highs:  Bullish MACD on the move. Hammer august month.  $S5FI - % of Stocks above 50Day MA - Very favorable bounce fro the lows in August reaffirms our outlook:  Fun Fact: S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones all reclaimed their 50D moving averages just as stocks are entering the worst month.\u00a0 Although September is historically the worst month on average, when the VIX fell under 14 in August, stocks finished September higher almost 90% of the time. Most of Wall Street is calling for a very bearish September. But what does actual data suggest?\u00a0 $SPX SPDR S&P 500 (NASDAQ:SPY) the last 14 times when index is up more than 10% through July with 0 or Negative return % in August, index rose 100% of the time with a median of 8.7% return. At the low end of spectrum if SPX rose even 3.0% as such in 1967, that would place index 4650s. That would be around March 2022 highs and new 52 week high. (CREDIT: Ned Davis Research)  Short term, we are expecting some choppy waters as markets determine direction. The immediate support we are looking at is 5DMA at 448, and 50DMA at 446. Remember that pullbacks are healthy and may need to backtest. If we look at what happened back in March lows and December 2022 lows, prices can breakout above the 20d/50d, but usually comes back at some point to retest support. If no major bad news, dips are buyable in these areas as market consolidates from a strong week caused by jobs data. MACD has turned bullish crossover for the time being and the setup looks more like March 2023 lows. This week if 450 holds, we want to see the 455 daily gap get filled.  Winning week on the Nasdaq Index as we saw $AAPL $TSLA $NVDA continue to bounce from August lows. Immediate support at 5DMA 374.79 for the moment. Bears were hammering the Head And Shoulders pattern after $NVDA earnings and while it did pan out for a day, The index has also moved above the 50DMA/20DMA. The 50D is at the 371 level and we also saw 380 handsomely rejected this week. As I say, every level every devil. As long as prices cruise above the 5DMA + 50DMA no worries here on buying the dips in tech.\u00a0  Perhaps the most obvious view of August 18th was the \u201clows\u201d. And August 28th was a successful retest before breaking out back to the upside trapping bears on this look. We are sticking with our target of 4550s, on this impulse move before coming back down towards 4500 for a backtest.\u00a0  To get the rest of our watch list on tech stocks such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) message me here.

                "title": "If You Invested $1,000 In Coca Cola Stock When Donald Trump Said Company Had 'Garbage' Drinks, Here's How Much You'd Have Today",
                "body": "Former President Donald Trump is back on X, formerly known as Twitter,\u00a0sharing his first post on the social media platform in the past\u00a0two years. Here\u2019s a look back at a tweet from Trump that took on one of the biggest companies in the world. What Happened: A study once found Trump to be the most active political leader on social media, with the stock market sometimes outperforming on days when he tweeted the most. Trump was banned from X in January 2021. Despite being unbanned from X when Elon Musk acquired the social media platform in November 2022, the former president waited until August 2023 to make his first post on the platform in more than two years. Trump shared his mug shot, which had gone viral on social media and\u00a0used the post to call out those against him and gain additional support for his 2024 presidential election campaign. While Trump publicly shares most of his opinions on Truth Social, a social media platform owned by his media company Trump Media & Technology Group, Americans could see a return of Trump on Twitter and his callouts of people and companies. Back in October 2012, Trump made a tweet that took on beverage giant Coca-Cola Co\u00a0(NYSE:KO). \u201cThe Coca Cola company is not happy with me \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll still keep drinking that garbage,\u201d Trump tweeted. The tweet came from Trump, who has been known as an avid soda\u00a0drinker with reports suggesting he drinks as many as 12 cans of Diet Coke daily. Years later, Trump would also take on Coca-Cola saying that his supporters should boycott the brand over the Georgia voting rights bill and the company\u2019s stance. While he may not be on the level of Jim Cramer and investors constantly betting against him, a pattern of investing when Trump goes against something could be an investment strategy. In 2019, Trump took on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and the cryptocurrency sector. \u201cI am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,\u201d Trump previously said. As shared by Benzinga, an investor who bought Bitcoin at the time of that tweet would be up over 141% in the last four years. Another famous example of Trump calling out a company was a 2014 tweet taking on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Trump shares his frustration with the company\u2019s iPhone smartphone. \u201cI predicted Apple\u2019s stock fall based on their dumb refusal to give the option of a larger iPhone screen like Samsung. I sold my Apple stock,\u201d Trump said at the time. As noted by Benzinga, Apple shares are up over 900% in the last nine years since Trump\u2019s tweet. Related Link:\u00a0Aspartame A Cancer Risk? Diet Coke, Pepsi Max And Diet Mountain Dew Could Be Impacted By New World Health Organization Ruling Investing $1,000 in Coca-Cola Stock: Investors who chose to go against Trump at the time of his callout of Coca-Cola having a \u201cgarbage\u201d product would have generated a positive return. A $1,000 investment in Coca-Cola on Oct. 16, 2012, could have bought 36.95 shares, based on a split and dividend-adjusted price. The $1,000 investment would be worth $2,175.62 today, based on a price of $58.88 for Coca-Cola stock at the time of writing. This represents a hypothetical return of 117.6% over the past\u00a011\u00a0years. When it comes to investing and advice on stocks like Coca-Cola and Apple, it would appear\u00a0investors are better off listening to legendary investor Warren Buffett and less so the former president.

                "body": "The Chinese government has banned its officials from using Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones and other foreign-branded devices at work, dealing a blow to the company just days ahead of its \u2018Wonderlust' iPhone 15 launch event. What Happened: Chinese government officials have been banned from using iPhones and other foreign-made devices at work, reported The Wall Street Journal. See Also: Apple Folded, But Why On Earth Is Tom Cruise's Cult Opposing Right To Repair? While China's iPhone ban applies only to government officials at work, the report says that the scope has been significantly expanded now. It could also be a tit-for-tat response from China after the US administration imposed a similar ban on Huawei and, more recently, TikTok. This is also the latest move in China's efforts to wean itself off of foreign technology \u2013 both hardware as well as software. The most significant move before this was the ban on foreign PC hardware and software in 2022, impacting Apple and Microsoft. Apart from this, the re-emergence of tech giant Huawei, which launched a new smartphone Mate 60 Pro. It is said to be powered by a 7-nanometer chipset, which seemed infeasible given the US' aggressive sanctions. Experts have called it a \"major blow\" to Huawei's former suppliers \u2013 most of which are American companies like Qualcomm and Google. Why It Matters: The ban will deal a body blow to Apple, which dominates the premium market in China. At the end of the June 2023 quarter, Apple was the third-largest smartphone maker in China, with a market share of 16%. According to analytics firm Counterpoint Research, it also posted the biggest year-on-year gains at a time when the broader smartphone shipments in China fell 4%. \"Apple still has no competitors in the high-end market which has proven to be more resilient during market headwinds,\" said Counterpoint Research. As a market, too, China is important for Apple, accounting for 19% of its overall revenue.

                "body": "This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal. In a recent ruling, a local consumer disputes resolution court in Northern India held\u00a0Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0India unit\u00a0accountable for deficient service. What Happened?\u00a0The case revolved around an iPhone, bought in Saudi Arabia and later given as a gift to Pankaj, the complainant. Shortly after receiving the gift, Pankaj noticed network and camera malfunctions. When he sought repairs, Apple\u2019s service centers cited internal damage, suggesting the device was out of warranty and implying potential tampering, according to livelaw.com, an Indian portal. Apple\u2019s defense hinged on the claim that the iPhone had been tampered with before repair, which would void the warranty. They offered an out-of-warranty repair, which Pankaj declined. See also:\u00a0iPhone 15 Likely To Hit Store Shelves In India Along With The World This Month However, the Commission, after examining the evidence, found inconsistencies in Apple\u2019s stance. Notably, a service report failed to mention any unauthorized modifications when the device was first submitted.\u00a0Pankaj asserted he hadn\u2019t altered the device, Apple couldn\u2019t provide counterproof. The verdict?\u00a0Apple must replace Pankaj\u2019s iPhone and compensate him \u20b910,000 (USD 120), plus cover \u20b915,000 ($180) in litigation expenses. This case underscores the importance of consumer rights and the scrutiny even tech giants like Apple can face when service falls short.

What Happened: The European Commission declared on Tuesday that tech mammoths such as\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG),\u00a0Amazon.com Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN),\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL),\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:FB),\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), and China\u2019s\u00a0ByteDance Ltd.\u00a0are to be monitored under the DMA. They have until March 2024 to comply with the new regulations. The DMA is designed to limit the market dominance of these tech companies. It requires them to compete based\u00a0on the merits of their\u00a0products and services. Major messaging apps will need to ensure their platforms are interoperable with competitors, and operating systems must support third-party app stores and alternate in-app payment options.

Apple's iMessage service and iPadOS are also under scrutiny. Companies are categorized as gatekeepers if they have\u00a0an annual turnover of over\u00a0\u20ac7.5 billion in Europe,\u00a0a market cap of over\u00a0\u20ac75 billion, and a service with\u00a0over 45 million monthly active\u00a0users in the EU. Those who fail to comply could face\u00a0fines of up to 10% of their\u00a0total worldwide turnover or as\u00a0much as 20% for\u00a0repeat offenders. Why It Matters: The DMA has been in the pipeline as part of the EU\u2019s efforts to curb the influence of tech giants, as revealed in a series of\u00a0European Commission press releases. The goal is to foster competition and prevent monopolistic practices. The DMA could significantly alter how these companies operate in Europe, impacting their business models. However, these companies have expressed concerns about the DMA\u2019s potential impacts.\u00a0Apple, for instance, voiced concerns\u00a0about the privacy and security risks the DMA poses, indicating that they will focus on mitigating these impacts while continuing to serve their European customers.

                "body": "Arm Holdings Ltd, a chip designer backed by\u00a0SoftBank Group Corp\u00a0(OTC:SFTBF) (OTC:SFTBY), has officially launched its roadshow for its highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO).\u00a0 The company aims to convince investors that it's worth as much\u00a0as $52 billion\u00a0in what could be the most significant share sale of the year. Also Read:\u00a0Databricks in Talks with T. Rowe Price for $43B Valuation, Eyes Expansion The roadshow commenced in Baltimore, the headquarters of influential asset manager\u00a0T. Rowe Price Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TROW), emphasizing the significance of the fund manager's role in significant IPOs.\u00a0 T Rowe Price has been an anchor investor in notable IPOs, including electric car maker\u00a0Rivian Automotive Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:RIVN) in 2021, valued at $66.5 billion. SoftBank offers 95.5 million American depository shares of Arm for $47 - $51 each, potentially raising to $4.87 billion at the top of the range.\u00a0 Arm's proposed valuation range is between $48 billion - $52 billion, possibly reaching $54.5 billion on a fully diluted basis. The valuation represents a decrease from the $64 billion at which SoftBank acquired the 25% stake it didn't already own in Arm last month.\u00a0 The market will closely watch the\u00a0IPO\u00a0for how Arm manages its relationship with its China business amid the ongoing technology tensions between China, and the U.S. SoftBank will retain 90.6% of Arm's ordinary shares after the IPO, with no proceeds going to the conglomerate. Arm has secured significant clients like\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL),\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA),\u00a0and Alphabet Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0GOOG) (NASDAQ:\u00a0GOOGL) as cornerstone investors in its IPO. Analysts suggest that Arm could benefit from the growing demand for artificial intelligence, riding on the coattails of Nvidia, which has surged in the AI sector. Arm's specialty in energy-efficient central processing units (CPUs) aligns with the AI boom, potentially driving its growth. Arm expects to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"ARM\" as it returns to the public markets. Price Action:\u00a0TROW shares traded higher by 0.97% at $112.90 premarket on the last check Wednesday.

Huawei's Resurgence in China:\u00a0 According to\u00a0BofA Securities\u00a0analyst Wamsi Mohan, Huawei's new Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro smartphones, featuring an in-house Kirin 9000S chip, could pose a threat to Apple's market share in China.\u00a0 Mohan estimates that if Huawei regains 10 million units of market share, it could dent Apple's fiscal 2024 earnings by approximately 11 cents per share.\u00a0More details here. Imoo Outpaces Apple Watch in China:\u00a0 Imoo, a Chinese smartwatch brand designed for children, has overtaken Apple Watch to become the second top-selling smartwatch brand in China.\u00a0 With features like remote monitoring and real-time location tracking, Imoo has captured 21% of the market, trailing only behind Huawei Technologies.\u00a0South China Morning Post\u00a0reports. iMessage on Android:\u00a0 Tech influencer Marques Brownlee has revealed two methods for Android users to access iMessage, challenging Apple's exclusivity.\u00a0 One method involves using AirMessage with a Mac as a server, while the other uses an invite-only app called Beeper.\u00a0 However, these methods raise questions about security and the need to log into an Apple ID on a remote Mac.\u00a0Read the full story here. Leaked iPhone 15 Pro Features:\u00a0 A leaked video has confirmed the presence of an Action button in the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro, replacing the traditional mute switch.\u00a0 This development comes ahead of the iPhone 15 range's expected unveiling on September 12, 2023.\u00a0More on this development.

                "body": "In a landmark decision, the European Union (EU) has labeled Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as one of six \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 in the digital market, sparking a swift response from the tech giant. The EU\u2019s designation comes under its new Digital Markets Act (DMA). The European Commission named six gatekeepers, including Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG),\u00a0Amazon.com Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN),\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL),\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:FB),\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), and China\u2019s\u00a0ByteDance Ltd., all required to ensure full compliance with DMA obligations within six months. Apple has been specifically accused of gatekeeping for its Safari browser, iOS operating system, and the App Store. The EU also plans to investigate Apple\u2019s iMessage service, despite the company\u2019s contention that it falls short of the new law\u2019s 45 million monthly active user threshold. See Also: EU Challenges Big Tech: Google Search, WhatsApp, TikTok, And 19 Others Face DMA Scrutiny As per iMore\u2019s report, Apple expressed deep concern over the privacy and data security risks the DMA poses. The company stated it will focus on mitigating these impacts while delivering top-quality products and services to its European customers. If Apple fails to comply, it could face a fine of up to 10% of its global turnover, which could rise to 20% for repeat offenses. The DMA\u2019s punitive measures also include \u201cbehavioral and structural remedies,\u201d which might force Apple to sell parts of its business for \u201csystematic infringements\u201d. The DMA\u2019s ruling may lead to significant changes in Apple\u2019s business model, potentially allowing third-party app stores and enabling users to uninstall default apps like Safari and Messages. Apple, however, has not indicated any intention to apply these changes beyond the EU. These developments and the company\u2019s response to the DMA\u2019s obligations will likely impact Apple\u2019s stock price.

It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: Currently, SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is trading above our crucial level of 447.94. For bullish traders, we're eyeing a rally up to 449.42, which we'd like to see established as support. Should the upward momentum continue, we anticipate a move towards 450.23, with a high target for the day at 451.61. Should the 447.94 level fail to hold, we expect bearish traders to aggressively sell down to 446.31. In the event of significant selling pressure, our bearish target for the day is 445.08. At the moment, QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) is trading below our key level of 377.58. For a bullish scenario, we aim to reclaim 377.58 as support. A break above this level on strong buying could propel the price to 378.93, with a high target for the day at 380.41. If sellers dominate today's trading, we'll be watching 375.98 as a critical support level. Failure to maintain above this level could see bears taking control, pushing the price down to 375.18 and potentially testing 373.82. Our bearish target for the day is 372.91. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) has opened lower but is trading above our level of 188.32. For bullish action, we're looking for this level to serve as support, aiming for a rally to 189.16 and possibly 189.52. Our high target for bullish traders today is 190.33. If 188.32 fails to hold, we anticipate a move down to 188.05. With continued selling, our bearish target for the day is 187.50, and if that level breaks, we're looking at 186.99. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading above our key level of 331.24. For the bulls, we're looking for this level to hold as support, with an upward move targeting 333.46. Sustained bullish momentum could take us to our high target for the day at 337.80. If 331.24 doesn't hold, we expect a sharp sell-off down to 328.52. Should this level break, our bearish target for the day is 326.05. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0is hovering around our key level of 135.97. For bullish traders, we're looking for this level to act as support, aiming for a move to 137.22 and potentially 138.03 as our high target for the day. If 135.97 fails to hold, we're watching for a test of the downside at 135.39. Should this level break, our bearish target for the day is 134.60. NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading around our key level of 483.43. For the bulls, we're looking for this level to hold and for the price to rally towards 489.04. If this level can be reclaimed, our high target for the day is 495.79. If 483.43 fails to hold as support, we expect bears to push the price down to 478.67. Should this level break, our bearish target for the day is 473.81, with a possibility of reaching 470.17 if selling continues.

Apparently, not the computerized clothing \u2014 at least it's not supposed to.\u00a0Business Insider reported that\u00a0the government aims to develop underwear that appears and performs just\u00a0like normal undergarments, but \"can also record your every move.\" In a separate press release from July,\u00a0SMART ePANTS program manager\u00a0Dawson Cagle stressed the importance of\u00a0developing\u00a0smart clothing that is indistinguishable from regular clothes.\u00a0 \"Making smart clothing with the same 'feel'\u00a0as regular clothing is critical for SMART ePANTS'\u00a0success,\"\u00a0Cagle said. \"This means sensors need to be integrated in such a way that the AST garment is just as stretchable, bendable, and supple as a comparable garment containing no electronics.\" The program will be launched in three phases including a\u00a0proof of concept phase called \"build it,\"\u00a0a \"wear it\" phase and finally a \"wash it\" phase. The government expects it to\u00a0significantly improve the capabilities of agencies like the Department of Defense, Central Intelligence Agency and Department Of Homeland Security. \"We\u2019ve moved computers into our smartphones. This is the chance to move computers into our clothing,\" Cagle added.

Also, Apple and its suppliers and other U.S. companies have been eying India to boost supply chains, reducing their dependence on China.\u00a0 Nvidia chief Jensen Huang's meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi further fueled speculations of Nvidia setting up a GPU and artificial intelligence\u00a0chip factory in India.

                "body": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are trading lower by 3.2% to $183.63\u00a0Wednesday afternoon amid overall market weakness and following a\u00a0WSJ report suggesting China has banned iPhone use for goverment officials at work. Per the WSJ report, China has directed central government agency officials to refrain from using foreign-branded devices, such as Apple's iPhones, for work or office entry. This directive, conveyed through workplace channels, aligns with Beijing's cybersecurity and technology self-reliance efforts. Foreign brands, notably Apple, heavily relies on China as a substantial market. WSJ says\u00a0the country contributes\u00a0approximately 19% of its total revenue. What's Going On With The Broader Market? Downward pressure on the broader market this week is being exacerbated by elevated oil prices, reaching their highest point since November 2022 due to Saudi Arabia and Russia extending their voluntary supply reductions. Rising Treasury yields are also responsible for the\u00a0downward pressure on risk assets. Higher interest rates can lead to increased borrowing costs for consumers. Apple sells a wide range of consumer electronics, including iPhones and MacBooks, many of which are purchased using credit. If higher interest rates make financing these purchases more expensive, it could reduce consumer demand for Apple's products, affecting the company's sales and revenue growth. See Also:\u00a0Fed Scrambles To Revise 2023 Projections As US Economy Surges Beyond Expectations Apple also operates globally and generates a significant portion of its revenue from international markets. Rising Treasury yields can lead to a stronger U.S. dollar, which can make Apple's products more expensive for international customers. This can reduce demand for Apple's products in foreign markets and negatively impact its sales and profitability. According to data from\u00a0Benzinga Pro, AAPL has a 52-week high of $198.23 and a 52-week low of $124.17.",

                "body": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is anticipated to include a USB-C charging port in its forthcoming iPhone, scheduled to be revealed on September 12, 2023. This move is expected to be well-received by both consumers and regulators. It aligns with a European Union regulation requiring phone makers to adopt a standard charging connection by December 2024. The regulation aims to reduce electronic waste and provide consumers with a cost-effective and convenient solution. The USB-C port is highly regarded for its fast charging capabilities, speedy data transfer, and widespread compatibility. By embracing this technology, Apple is positioning itself as a brand that not only listens to consumer demands but also supports global sustainability objectives. Apple's stock performance amidst significant product design changes has proven impressive and resilient. Despite a period of correction, the tech giant's stock reached a new all-time high of $198 per share on July 19th, coming just shy of the highly anticipated $200 mark. However, this surge met resistance, leading to a 13% drop in the stock price to $171. Notably, the previous all-time high of $182 in January 2022 failed to prevent this decline by acting as a level of support.  Apple's stock has displayed impressive resilience despite recent setbacks. After hitting a low of $171, the stock has successfully broken through the $182 resistance level, now acting as a strong support level. This rebound not only indicates a recovery, but also reflects a positive and bullish sentiment among investors. As a result, the stock has risen a remarkable 10% and now boasts an impressive year-to-date increase of 45%. By embracing regulatory changes and integrating consumer-friendly features such as USB-C, the company can strengthen its standing in the market, and investor confidence is likely to be boosted, as demonstrated by the stock's impressive rebound after a bout of instability. After the closing bell on Tuesday, September 5, the stock closed at $189.70, trading up by 0.16%.",

                "body": "The highly-anticipated launch of\u00a0YouTube\u2019s NFL\u00a0\u201cSunday Ticket\u201d streaming service is set to take place this weekend, marking a significant shift in the sports broadcasting landscape. What Happened: This weekend will be the first instance of YouTube TV hosting the\u00a0NFL\u2019s\u00a0out-of-market Sunday afternoon games, a position previously held by\u00a0DirecTV\u00a0since 1994,\u00a0reported\u00a0NBC News.\u00a0 YouTube TV inked a seven-year contract with the\u00a0NFL last December, worth over $2 billion per season. This inaugural \u201cNFL Sunday Ticket\u201d season on YouTube TV is a significant part of this endeavor. The package, which aligns with NFL Commissioner\u00a0Roger Goodell\u2019s\u00a0goal of reaching a wider audience through streaming, will be available as an add-on on YouTube TV or separately on YouTube Primetime Channels.

In late May, YouTube TV encountered extensive service disruptions during the initial pair of matches in the\u00a0NBA\u2019s Eastern Conference\u00a0finals featuring the\u00a0Boston Celtics\u00a0and\u00a0Miami Heat, the report noted.\u00a0 Christian Oestlien, YouTube\u2019s vice president of product, said that the platform has invested considerably in infrastructure and systems to ensure a smooth viewing experience.\u00a0 Despite the wider reach, \u201cSunday Ticket\u201d\u00a0remains a premium product.\u00a0 It is available to YouTube TV subscribers for $299, while non-subscribers need to shell out $399. Additional packages, such as the NFL RedZone channel, can be added for an extra cost. The service will allow fans to watch multiple games simultaneously, introducing a new level of engagement on the platform. Why It Matters: Last year, YouTube, owned by\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL),\u00a0outbid several tech and streaming companies, including perceived frontrunner\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), for the rights to NFL Sunday Ticket.\u00a0 The move generated mixed reactions across social media, primarily due to the price increase. This strategic move by YouTube and the NFL indicates a broader trend toward streaming services\u00a0acquiring sports broadcasting rights.\u00a0 As traditional cable TV continues to lose ground, the success of YouTube\u2019s NFL Sunday Ticket could pave the way for more such partnerships.

What Happened: A\u00a0BBC report\u00a0highlighted an ongoing dispute between the government and tech companies over the proposed legislation.\u00a0 Under the bill, messaging platforms like\u00a0Signal,\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0WhatsApp, and\u00a0Apple Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iMessage\u00a0would be required to provide access to users\u2019 encrypted messages in case of suspicions of child abuse content.

                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has scheduled its \u201cWonderlust\u201d iPhone 15 launch event for Sept. 12, and typically the stock rallies in the run-up to the event. This time around, things could be different, according to Daniel Niles, founder and portfolio manager at Satori Fund. What Happened: Since Niles recommended buying Apple for a high probability trade on Aug. 18, going into the iPhone 15 launch event, the stock has gained 9%, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 3% gain, the fund manager said. Niles said he is starting to sell his Apple position, given Chinese tech company Huawei\u2019s breakthrough with its 7nm processor node technology for its new Mate60 Pro that promises 5G-like speed. \u201cPlan to be short $AAPL near IP 15 launch,\u201d he added. The Huawei Threat: Explaining his rationale, the fund manager noted that Huawei had a nearly 19% peak smartphone share in 2019 and its market share was crushed following the U.S. semiconductor ban.  The initial batch of Huawei\u2019s Mate 60 Pro, priced at $960, sold out within hours of the commencement of presale, and other interested customers have placed orders for future purchases, the Wall Street Journal said.  See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock The fund manager also sees a hit from China getting too aggressive with the ban on foreign phones in government offices. Apple derives about 19% of its revenue from China, he said. A Bloomberg report said Thursday that China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments to government-backed agencies and state companies. Martin Yang, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said, \u201cThe government ban and the new Huawei phone will be material events for the iPhone,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported. \"The two combined will drive more Android users to upgrade to Huawei, or iPhone users going back to Huawei,\u201d the analyst said, adding that Apple could lose 10 million iPhone shipments in 2024 due to the new Huawei phone. Unattractive Valuation: Nile noted that Apple is trading at a P/E multiple of 29 times the estimated earnings for 2023 for a 1-2% revenue growth in calendar years 2022/2023. The is high relative to the S&P 500\u2019s P/E multiple of 21 times.   Apple ended Wednesday\u2019s session down 3.58% at $182.91, according to Benzinga Pro data.

                "body": "Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly gearing up to unveil Siri 2.0, a transformative update designed to address long-standing criticisms and\u00a0challenge its rivals\u00a0head-on in the voice assistant war. What Happened:\u00a0For the past decade, Siri, Apple\u2019s virtual assistant, has been a staple feature in iPhones and other Apple devices. However, it\u2019s no secret that Siri has fallen behind competitors like\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0Google Assistant\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0Alexa\u00a0in terms of functionality and user satisfaction. Siri\u2019s journey began in 2011, and it was revolutionary at the time, giving the iPhone a unique edge in the market, but now, the luster has faded.\u00a0 Users have grown\u00a0increasingly frustrated with Siri\u2019s limitations, often encountering misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and limited capabilities compared to its competitors. Enter Siri 2.0, Apple\u2019s ambitious response to these challenges.\u00a0 The tech giant has invested in artificial intelligence, allocating substantial resources to improve its voice assistant.\u00a0Cupertino has reportedly been recruiting\u00a0top-tier engineers and forming specialized teams to work on generative AI projects, similar to the technologies behind\u00a0ChatGPT. See Also:\u00a0Apple, Microsoft Hustle To Keep iMessage, Bing Off EU\u2019s Tech\u2019 Gatekeepers\u2019 List: Report Apple\u2019s Foundational Models team, led by former Google veteran\u00a0Ruoming Pang, has been at the forefront of these efforts.\u00a0 Despite its relatively small size, the team has made significant strides in training advanced large-language models or LLMs that rival even those developed by\u00a0OpenAI, a company that invested over $100 million in similar technology,\u00a0reported\u00a0AppleInsider.\u00a0 Apple has dedicated resources to at least two additional teams developing language and image models.\u00a0 One team focuses on Visual Intelligence, with a primary goal of generating images, videos, and 3D scenes, whereas another team is actively engaged in developing multimodal AI, enabling it to handle text, images, and videos, the report noted citing The Information.\u00a0 The core objective of Siri 2.0 is to integrate these advanced LLMs into the voice assistant, enabling users to automate complex tasks using natural language, much like Google\u2019s enhancements to Google Assistant. Apple is confident that its proprietary language model,\u00a0Ajax GPT, outpaces OpenAI\u2019s\u00a0GPT 3.5. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0This endeavor comes with certain challenges. Unlike competitors that rely on cloud-based models, Apple prefers on-device processing for improved privacy and performance.\u00a0 The trade-off is that Apple\u2019s LLMs are substantial and complex, making it a struggle to fit them into the limited space of an\u00a0iPhone. To tackle this hurdle, the tech giant may follow in the footsteps of Google, which developed\u00a0PaLM2, a large model that offers different sizes, including one suitable for devices and offline use, the report stated.\u00a0\u00a0 Although Apple\u2019s exact approach remains undisclosed, it\u2019s conceivable that the company will opt for smaller LLMs to safeguard user privacy.

                "title": "Why Are Apple Shares Falling Over 2% Premarket Today?",
                "body": "Shares of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined in premarket trading on Thursday, signaling that the stock could extend its losses for a second straight session. The stock ended Wednesday\u2019s session down 3.58% at $182.91, according to Benzinga Pro data. In premarket trading, the stock was losing 2.64% to $178.09. The negative sentiment toward Apple\u2019s shares was built on the back of two developments. Chinese tech company Huawei, which once held an appreciable share of the domestic smartphone market, lost ground amid the U.S. ban on its telecommunication equipment.   Huawei has launched Mate 60 Pro, a faster smartphone that has undercut the iPhone, just ahead of the unveiling of Apple\u2019s next iteration of its flagship product. An Oppenheimer analyst estimated that Apple could lose 10 million iPhone shipments in 2024 due to the new Huawei phone. The stock also took a hit from China\u2019s decision to ban iPhones from government offices. A Bloomberg report said Thursday that China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments to government-backed agencies and state companies. The focus now shifts to the Sept. 12 iPhone launch event, which Apple has promoted with the tagline \u2018Wonderlust.\u2019 See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock",

                "body": "The\u00a0UK Government\u00a0has refuted claims of retracting its Online Safety Bill, causing uncertainty over the future of\u00a0Apple Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) iMessage service in the country. According to\u00a0Reuters, the government had previously asked Apple to disable end-to-end encryption on iMessage for security reasons. However, a recent report suggested that it was planning to abandon this requirement, a claim the government has now denied. The Online Safety Bill originally demanded\u00a0messaging services like iMessage and\u00a0WhatsApp allow scanning of messages for illicit content. The Financial Times reported that the UK Government decided not to employ controversial powers to scrutinize messaging apps until it becomes \u201ctechnically feasible\u201d. See Also:\u00a0Elon Musk Has A Word Of Caution Over Lucid CEO Rawlinson\u2019s Pay: \u2018Beware Any Company Where\u2026\u2019 Despite this report, UK Technology Minister Michelle Donelan insisted on Times Radio that the government has not changed its stance on encryption, stating,\u00a0\u201cWe haven\u2019t changed the bill\u00a0at all\u201d. On September 6, the EU\u00a0identified Apple as a digital gatekeeper under its new Digital Markets Act. This could potentially restrict iMessage operations in mainland Europe while remaining functional in the UK. The UK Government\u2019s main motive behind\u00a0the Online Safety Bill was\u00a0to safeguard children and detect\u00a0illegal child sexual abuse content.\u00a0However, compelling a firm like Apple, known for\u00a0user privacy and end-to-end encryption,\u00a0to alter its ethos has proven challenging. Apple, which recently abandoned its\u00a0plans to scan for CSAM\u00a0material due to concerns of intrusion and misuse, hopes to resolve the UK encryption dispute, especially in light of potential significant operational changes resulting from the EU\u2019s landmark designation.

                "body": "China's move against the U.S. to broaden its ban on iPhones in sensitive departments encompassing government-backed agencies and state companies signaled increasing difficulties for\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its largest foreign market and\u00a0global production hub. The ban comes on the heels of Apple's latest iPhone model launch. This move comes amid\u00a0Beijing's efforts to\u00a0reduce reliance on American technology, further fueled by the U.S. sanctions on China over semiconductor technology and efforts to reduce supply chain dependence on China. Several agencies have already instructed their staff not to bring iPhones to work. Additionally, Beijing aims to extend this restriction to numerous state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled entities, Bloomberg\u00a0reports.\u00a0 The potential blockade is part of China's long-standing endeavor to eliminate foreign technology from sensitive environments. The unprecedented measure threatens Apple's position in a market responsible for about a fifth of its revenue and where it manufactures most of the world's iPhones through extensive Chinese factories.\u00a0 The extent to which companies and agencies will adopt these restrictions remains uncertain, with some prohibiting iPhones in the workplace while others may ban them entirely.\u00a0 Other U.S. companies with significant exposure to China, including\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), are also jittering over China's next move. Several U.S. chipmakers had already discussed with the U.S. government to go a little softer on\u00a0its China policy. Last week,\u00a0Huawei Technologies Co, Ltd's\u00a0release of a smartphone with an advanced made-in-China processor was seen as a victory against U.S. sanctions. Despite increasing tensions between the U.S. and China, Apple relies heavily on the Asian country for manufacturing and as a significant market.\u00a0 Meanwhile, as Rhodium Group estimates, Chinese businesses have cut investment in the U.S. to the lowest since the global financial crisis. The value of completed Chinese foreign direct investment transactions in the U.S. was $2.49 billion in 2022, less than half the amount in 2021 and the smallest since\u00a02009. The size of assets held by Chinese companies in the U.S. stagnated at $282 billion as of 2021, roughly the same level as in 2017. Employment by Chinese firms in the U.S. dropped to just 140,000 in 2021, a decline of over 60% from 2017.

Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is currently trading below our pivotal 445.08 mark. For bullish momentum, a reclaim of 445.08 is essential. A strong bullish sign would be a surge above 446.31, establishing it as a support. A further upward move could target 447.94. Our optimistic target for SPY today is 449.42. If 445.08 isn't firmly established as support, we anticipate a bearish move towards 443.90 and then 443.42. A significant sell-off that breaches 443.42 would likely target 442.61. In a strong bearish scenario, our target for SPY is 441.06. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) have seen a dip overnight and are hovering around our 371.96 mark. For bullish traders, a move towards 372.91 is the goal. With sustained buying, reclaiming 373.82 as support is crucial. For a bullish dominance, we'd like to see sustained trading above 373.82. A strong buying spree could push the price towards 375.18, with an ultimate bullish target of 375.98. If selling persists, bears might push towards 370.91. If 370.91 doesn't hold, a further decline towards 370.08 is likely. A breach here could see a move to 369.39. Our bearish target for the day stands at 368.57. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen a dip and is trading above our 177.31 mark. For bullish momentum, holding 177.31 as support and rallying towards 178.18 and then 178.61 is key. A strong bullish push could target 179.36 and potentially 180.60. Our optimistic bull target for Apple today is 181.25. If 177.31 doesn't hold, a bearish move towards 176.84 is anticipated. Strong selling could push the price to 176.29, with a bearish target of 175.81. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is trading above our 331.24 mark. Bullish traders would want to see this level hold and a rally towards 333.46. A sustained move could target 335.96, with an ultimate bullish target of 337.80. If 331.24 is breached, a bearish move towards 328.52 is likely. A significant decline could target 326.05. Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) hovers around our 246.16 mark. Bullish momentum would require holding this as support and targeting 248.37, with a high bull target of 250.25. If 246.16 is breached, bears might target 243.98, with a low bear target of 242.47. NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) trades around our 458.20 mark. For bulls, holding this level and targeting 461.49 is key. If 489.04 is reclaimed, a bullish buying spree could target 464.95. If 458.20 doesn't hold, a bearish move towards 454.09 is anticipated, with a strong bearish target of 447.05.

                "body": "Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPod Nano turns 18 today. Steve Jobs introduced the iPod Nano to the world on Sept. 7, 2005, while his competitors were focused on mimicking the iPod Mini. It witnessed significant changes over seven iterations before being discontinued in 2017. The iPod Nano marked a pivotal moment in Apple\u2019s history. This sleek and compact digital music player revolutionized how people listened to music and epitomized Apple\u2019s commitment to innovative design and consumer technology. Its arrival also brought a new level of portability, style, and functionality to the world of personal music players. See Also: This Day In Apple History: Steve Jobs Resigned As CEO 12 Years Ago And Handed Reins To Tim Cook The iPod Nano was introduced to the world in iconic Jobs style. Despite the iPod's success \u2013 it was the most popular MP3 player in the world at the time \u2013 Apple didn't hesitate to launch the Nano. \"We're gonna do something bold today. We're gonna replace it with something new,\" Jobs said to a roaring crowd. \"The iPod Nano is the biggest revolution since the iPod,\" Jobs said. He pointed at the watch pocket in his pair of jeans and asked the crowd what it would be used for. \"Ever wonder what this pocket's for? I've always wondered that. Well, now we know because this is the new iPod [Nano],\" he said, pulling out the iPod Nano and showing it to the world for the first time. Apple launched the iPod Nano with up to 4GB capacity, starting at $199. The first million units were sold in 17 days, helping Apple make a record $1 billion profit in 2005. Over the years, the iPod Nano underwent several transformations to keep up with evolving technology and consumer demands. Subsequent generations featured improved storage capacity, enhanced battery life, and additional features such as video playback and a built-in FM radio. The third-generation Nano, released in 2007, introduced a square form factor with a larger screen. The fourth-generation model brought accelerometer-based games and shake-to-shuffle functionality. The fifth-generation Nano incorporated a video camera, making it a versatile multimedia device. However, with smartphones gaining popularity and quickly becoming an all-in-one device for music, calling, texting, and more, the iPod Nano was inching towards its discontinuation. The final iteration of the iPod Nano, the seventh generation, was released in 2012. It featured a 2.5-inch multitouch display and came with 16GB storage capacity. Priced at $149, it was the last of its kind before Apple ceased production of the iPod Nano in 2017. The iPod Nano is now a vintage Apple product, but its significance as a portable music player remains etched in the hearts of Apple and music fans.

It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "title": "Three Ways I Use RSI To Analyze Trends, And Why Alphabet Is Still In A Clear Bullish Phase",
                "body": "Novice investors usually go on a \u201cHoly Grail quest\u201d early on, reading books and watching videos and searching for that elusive one indicator to rule them all.\u00a0 After 23 years of analyzing the markets using technical analysis, I will tell you one thing for sure\u2026 There is no Holy Grail. What I will also tell you is that there are a number of technical indicators that do a very good job of helping the astute investor to analyze trends, quantify investor sentiment, and anticipate inflection points in price. One of my favorite indicators to do all of the above is the Relative Strength Index or RSI.\u00a0Created by Welles Wilder and promoted in his classic text, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems (featured in our Recommended Reading List!), the RSI has become my go-to oscillator to better understand price dynamics. Today I\u2019ll show three ways that I use the RSI to identify short-term price swings, determine trend phases, and anticipate market turns. When I was first introduced to technical indicators, I was kindly asked (that is, forced) to prove out the calculations to about 20 indicators in Excel.\u00a0The idea was that by understanding the math behind each indicator, I could better understand how it was using inputs of price and/or volume and how the output could be used to anticipate turning points. Wilder originally designed RSI for the commodity markets, and for him it was all about mean reversion.\u00a0In other words, the goal was to buy low and sell high, and RSI was a tool to try and optimize those entry and exit points.  The chart of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX)\u00a0has plenty of examples of where overbought conditions were followed by short-term drops, and oversold conditions usually happen right before a bounce higher.\u00a0To be clear, the real signal is not when the indicator enters the overbought/oversold region, but rather where it exits that extreme condition. Buy signals in February, May, and August 2023 all worked quite well, as gold stocks bounced higher in each instance.\u00a0Sell signals in January and April 2023 also worked out, with price pulling back in both cases. Sometimes, those extreme readings become a little more complex, and we need to add divergences to our technical analysis arsenal. It makes sense that when a stock is an uptrend, the RSI will tend to get to the overbought region.\u00a0Price is going higher, driven by stronger upside momentum, so an overbought condition should be expected.\u00a0So when the price continues higher not on stronger momentum but weaker momentum, that\u2019s when we may need to take action.  Notice how Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made higher highs every month from January to July?\u00a0 Now focus on the highs in late June and mid-July.\u00a0The price of AAPL continued to grind higher, but the RSI actually sloped lower.\u00a0This pattern of higher prices and lower momentum is called a bearish momentum divergence and usually indicates a bullish phase that is \u201crunning out of gas\u201d.\u00a0 In other words, the end of the trend is near! We noticed bearish divergences on key growth stocks back in July, which meant the subsequent drop in August was a likely next step for the markets.\u00a0But how can we relate short-term RSI signals to long-term trends?\u00a0This is where Connie Brown\u2019s work completely changed how I use the Relative Strength Index. The earlier example using gold stocks provided a decent illustration of overbought and oversold conditions.\u00a0But sometimes the RSI never gets to an extreme reading.\u00a0Does that mean the indicator is broken?\u00a0No, it means the price is trending. In Connie Brown\u2019s groundbreaking book, Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional (another book featured in our Recommended Reading List!), she explains how the range shown by the RSI over time can tell you about the overall trend structure.  When a chart is in a confirmed downtrend of lower highs and lower lows, the RSI often becomes oversold on the downswings.\u00a0But the countertrend moves back to the upside usually stall out with an RSI around 60.\u00a0You\u2019ll see the opposite in an uptrend, where the RSI often becomes overbought on a move higher but rarely breaks below 40 on pullbacks. Here's that same chart of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) but with the phases indicated with a shaded RSI.  Through the end of 2022, Alphabet was in a clear downtrend phase.\u00a0The fact the RSI never really broke above 60 on upswings tells us that while we are seeing some countertrend bounces, the overall trend remains bearish. Note how the pattern changes in January 2023, with the RSI pushing up to 70 on a rally.\u00a0This was an early indication that something had changed and that the overall downtrend phase was evolving into a new uptrend phase. As long as GOOGL becomes overbought on upswings, and the RSI remains above 40 on pullbacks, the RSI is telling us that the overall trend remains bullish. I\u2019ve found the Relative Strength Index to be an effective way of anticipating turning points, recognizing trend shifts, and confirming market phases.\u00a0By applying indicators like RSI in a consistent and disciplined manner, an astute investor can use price momentum to better identify entry and exit points in any market environment.

According to analysts at Bank of America, including Wamsi Mohan and Joseph Leeman, China constitutes a significant market for the Cupertino-based company, accounting for approximately 40-50 million iPhone units sold by Apple or 20% of the total number of iPhones sold in 2022.  Should this ban be enforced, it could result in a substantial headwind of 5 to 10 million units, significantly impacting the tech giant, the analysts said in a Thursday note.  Furthermore, if iPhones are barred from official workplaces, the repercussions could be even more severe, given the proclivity of Chinese consumers to own and use multiple smartphones. This isn\u2019t merely a random act of iPhone sabotage by China; it\u2019s part of Beijing\u2019s long-running mission to reduce its reliance on foreign technology, especially in sensitive sectors. Bank of America stated that the recent arrival of a Chinese-made high-end smartphone as a real competitor to an iPhone corresponds with the start of this possible ban. Huawei recently unveiled its latest Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro smartphones, equipped with the in-house Kirin 9000s chip, which exhibits performance levels on par with 5G speeds. This launch signifies a substantial achievement for the company, especially in light of the significant supply disruptions it faced following U.S. sanctions in 2019.  The math is stark \u2013 for every 1 million iPhones sold, there\u2019s a potential $0.01-per-share impact on Apple\u2019s earnings, according to Bank of America. In an alarming twist, if Huawei claws back 10 million units from Apple in China, it could translate into an 11-cent headwind to Apple\u2019s 2024 earnings per share.  But the nightmare scenario? Losing the 30 million units gained since the sanctions began, which could deliver a gut punch of 34 cents per share on Apple.  Shares of Apple Inc. were 3.1% lower at the time of writing on Thursday, after falling 3.6% on Wednesday. Read now: iPhone 15 Colors Leaked Ahead Of Launch: Uninspiring Or A Welcome Change?

                "body": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to release a handful of new products at its\u00a0upcoming\u00a0\"Wonderlust\"\u00a0event next week, but all eyes will be on the iPhone 15. Here's what to expect and why it matters for Apple stock.\u00a0 What To Know: Morgan Stanley and Wedbush\u00a0laid out expectations for the iPhone 15 launch ahead of the event next week.\u00a0 Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring anticipates limited \"catch-up\" upgrades for the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models, but the analyst sees some bigger changes coming to the Pro models.\u00a0Wedbush analyst Dan Ives shared similar expectations, including a strategic pricing move. iPhone Pro and Pro Max updates could include thinner bezels, a new titanium casing and more rounded edges. Both\u00a0analysts also expect\u00a0Apple to enhance the camera quality by adding a new periscope lens, which will offer improved zoom capabilities. Ives called this the \"star of the launch.\" The smartphones are also likely to feature faster chips and a new \"Action Button\" which will allow users to run preselected functions without having to unlock their phones.\u00a0 Other product launches could include new Apple Watch models and new AirPods, but again, everyone is focused on the new family of iPhones. Check This Out:\u00a0iPhone 15 Colors Leaked Ahead Of Launch - Uninspiring Or A Welcome Change? Why It Matters: In a new note to clients, Woodring said he believes iPhone estimates for 2024 are too low.\u00a0 \"While the iPhone event has historically been a 'sell-the-news'\u00a0event, we continue to see upside to Consensus and buyside expectations as FY24 tailwinds outweigh the headwinds,\" the Morgan Stanley analyst said. Morgan Stanley's estimates for iPhone revenues next year are about 8% higher than the consensus. The firm is even higher than the Street on shipments for 2024.\u00a0 \"We believe that as FY24 iPhone expectations move higher, Apple can continue to outperform, as positive estimate revisions offset very moderate multiple compression,\" Woodring said. Ives echoed much of the same sentiment. He noted that it's the right time for\u00a0Apple to raise prices on its iPhones. The Wedbush analyst expects a $100 jump in base prices for the Pro models.\u00a0 \"Importantly, we expect some massive discounts/promotions from US carriers over the coming months which should further catalyze iPhone 15 sales out of the gates and take the sting of a slight price increase away,\" Ives said in a new note to clients. This iPhone cycle is really a\u00a0\"golden installed base story,\" he said. Webush\u00a0estimates that approximately 25% of iPhone users have not upgraded in four years, which sets the company up for a \"mini super cycle.\" Both Morgan Stanley and Wedbush have Overweight/Outperform\u00a0ratings on Apple stock with price targets of $215 and $230, respectively. The \"Wonderlust\"\u00a0launch event\u00a0is set to kick off\u00a0at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California on Sept. 12. AAPL Price Action: At the time of publication, Apple shares were down 2.78% at $177.82,\u00a0adding to losses for the week largely due to iPhone bans in China.\u00a0 Photo: courtesy of Apple.\u00a0",

                "body": "Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares are trading lower Thursday amid competitive concerns from Huawei, which announced its Mate 60 Pro with a new 7nm chip. What To Know: Qualcomm stock fell over 7% Thursday in response to the news. Huawei could be positioned to retake its market leadership position, with Qualcomm most vulnerable to such a change, if the company can effectively utilize SMIC's 14nm and 7nm process manufacturing and R&D personnel to grow technology and output competitiveness. Some stocks in the chip sector may also be under pressure Thursday after China implemented its first comprehensive measure aimed at banning the use of Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices for official use. The ban is part of Beijing's ongoing endeavor to diminish its dependence on foreign technology, particularly in sectors that are considered sensitive. China has supported its efforts with the introduction of a Chinese-made high-end smartphone which can realistically compete with the iPhone. Huawei's Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro smartphones,\u00a0boasting performance levels matching those of 5G speeds, play an important role in China's departure from foreign technology.

                "body": "Data, in today's world, is as valuable as gold, and\u00a0Generative AI is using this wealth to forge\u00a0innovations that were previously unimaginable. With the rise of Generative AI, giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) could be overshadowed, as new entrants harness the power of large language models (LLMs) to redefine industries, Needham & Company said Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know. The AAPL Analyst: Needham analyst\u00a0Laura Martin reiterated a Buy rating on Apple with a $195 price target. The AAPL Takeaways: Apple and fellow tech giants face a monumental shift in the industry, with generative AI poised to introduce novel products and reduce costs, potentially sidelining traditional tech powerhouses. \"Many of these companies (including AAPL) are about to get dwarfed by generative AI, in our view,\" Martin said in a note to investors. Economic systems will play a pivotal role in shaping the AI adoption trajectory, the Needham analyst said. In staunch capitalist environments, laggards in adopting generative AI might find themselves edged out in a few years, she added. Read Also:\u00a0Sam Altman Asks People To 'Calm Down' Before OpenAI Hosts Its First Developer Conference The arena of media and internet is particularly poised for an overhaul, thanks to generative AI. While it's early days to pinpoint the potential underperformers, entities controlling LLMs are emerging as clear frontrunners, Martin noted. Needham said Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) are the clear standouts so far. But, procuring data for the LLMs is seeing an uptick in costs, the analyst said, hinting that future LLMs might come with heftier price tags. The crux of generative AI's power is anchored in the quality and contextuality of data within the LLM, which underscores the role of data in turbocharging AI's capability, be it in birthing avant-garde products or trimming overheads. Apple's narrative here is nuanced \u2014 while it might remain on the fringes of the generative AI surge, its fortress-like ecosystem could act as a bulwark against major setbacks. However, Needham\u2019s spotlight is on Android, bolstered by Google's arsenal spanning cloud computing, generative AI, and a trove of first-party global consumer data, poised to possibly eclipse Apple in the race. The analyst said instead of spreading bets thin on potential laggards, hedge on the assured winners \u2014 the tech arsenal providers including Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's OpenAI, and Google Cloud.

Camera is 10% better? See Also:\u00a0App Store Showdown: Elon Musk & Spotify CEO Call Out Apple\u2019s Stranglehold On Twitter Subscriptions Musk's comment set off a flurry of discussions in the comment section.

To the lay person they are the same as what you see in iPhone (new color, new camera, new glass, added feature, etc). To tesla fans and Elon it's massively improved and advanced.

Why It's Important:\u00a0The\u00a0iPhone 15 launch\u00a0is all set for Sept. 12 with some major upgrades like thinner bezels, camera upgrades, a new Action Button, and other design and hardware improvements. In addition, the USB Type-C port is all set to\u00a0make its debut\u00a0on the iPhone \u2013 all four iPhone 15 models are expected to use the universal Type-C port in compliance with new European Union regulations.

                "body": "The future of Disney may involve a possible acquisition by tech giant Apple, according to recent speculation amongst Disney insiders. What Happened: As per a\u00a0Business Insider report\u00a0on Wednesday, speculation has resurfaced about Apple\u2019s potential acquisition of Disney. This comes after\u00a0Bob Iger\u00a0returned to his position as CEO of\u00a0Disney\u00a0(NYSE:DIS) less than a year ago. Several past and present Disney executives reportedly believe that Iger\u2019s \u201cend game\u201d\u00a0is to stay on and\u00a0sell Disney to\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). This theory has been debated for years, despite Apple\u2019s history of infrequent major acquisitions, reported Business Insider citing CNBC. Apple\u2019s largest purchase until now remains\u00a0its 2015 acquisition of Beats\u00a0for $3 billion. However, the possibility of regulatory approval for such a mega-deal between Apple and Disney raises questions. See Also:\u00a0New Twist In Disney Vs DeSantis: Mouse House Now Wants To Scale Down Federal Lawsuit Against Florida Gove Neither Disney nor Apple have responded to the speculation. The Disney CEO has previously indicated a willingness to sell\u00a0non-core Disney assets, including ABC\u00a0and cable networks like FX\u00a0and National Geographic. Iger has\u00a0had a long-standing relationship with\u00a0the late Steve Jobs and by extension, Apple. After\u00a0Disney\u2019s acquisition of Pixar in\u00a02006, Jobs became Disney\u2019s largest\u00a0shareholder. Iger joined Apple\u2019s board\u00a0after Jobs\u2019 death in 2011. In a 2019 book, Iger expressed his belief\u00a0that if Steve Jobs were\u00a0alive, the two companies might have merged. This belief has been echoed by analysts who suggest\u00a0that an Apple acquisition of\u00a0Disney could be mutually beneficial. Why It Matters:\u00a0Back in 2021, Iger revealed in an interview that a merger between Disney and Apple might have been a possibility\u00a0if Jobs were still\u00a0alive. He suggested that Disney\u2019s content would have been a natural fit for the iPhone maker. Fast forward to\u00a0July 2023, Iger\u2019s comments led to speculation of a potential sale of Disney assets, sending the company\u2019s stock price to lows seen during the COVID-19 period. This recent development has rekindled previous speculations among insiders of a potential Disney-Apple merger.

                "body": "A couple of developments related to China rocked tech stocks on Thursday as fears of an aggravation of the trade war between the world\u2019s top two economies intensify. Against his backdrop, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya shared on X data that showed the U.S. diversifying away from China. What Happened: \u201cFirst time since 2003, US imports more from Mexico than China\u2026,\u201d Palihapitiya tweeted early Friday and shared a graphic from BofA Securities, which showed the percentage of U.S. imports from Mexico on a 12-month moving average basis exceeded imports from China for the first time since 2023. First time since 2003, US imports more from Mexico than China\u2026 pic.twitter.com/IqTiIjczFW  U.S. multinationals, including Apple and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have China as their major production base. China also double up as a major market for these companies and other major tech giants such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA). A potential U.S.-China trade war would stifle the recovery seen by tech companies following 2022\u2019s dismal showing, putting further pressure on topline and margins. The data that shows U.S. diversification away from China could be good news, allaying fears concerning a deep hit to the domestic economy. Tesla, which produces roughly half of its electric vehicles in China, currently has begun construction of a Gigafactory in Mexico. Mexico\u2019s rise in ranks as the top U.S. trading partner bodes well as the North American Free Trade Agreement signed among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in 1992 eliminates most trade barriers and tariffs for goods and services trade between any of these three nations.

                "body": "Apple's China headache could worsen with the Xi Jinping administration expanding the iPhone ban further to include several other state-run and state-controlled agencies. What Happened: The Xi Jinping administration is planning to broaden the scope of its iPhone ban from just government employees to those working in other state-run agencies and other government-controlled organizations, reported Bloomberg. See Also: iPhone 15 May Face Hurdle In China As Government Officials Receive Foreign Device Ban, Says Report The broadening scope of the iPhone ban comes two days after Chinese officials were ordered to stop bringing iPhones and other foreign-branded phones to work. This spooked the markets, too, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares ending Thursday 2.9% in the red. Apple's shares are down 6.2% this week alone. Earlier on Wednesday, a report stated that the Chinese government had banned its officials from using Apple's iPhones and other foreign-made devices at work. Another report from Nikkei Asia said that the China iPhone ban has been expanded to employees of local governments, prefectures, cities, and state-owned enterprises. As of 2021, China had over 56 million central and local government employees. Why It Matters: The broadening of China's iPhone ban comes days before the highly-anticipated launch of the iPhone 15 series at the September 12 Wonderlust event. It also coincides with the re-emergence of tech giant Huawei, which launched a new smartphone, Mate 60 Pro. It is said to be powered by a 7-nanometer chipset, which seemed infeasible given the US\u2019 aggressive sanctions. Apple also dominates the high-end market in China's smartphone industry \u2013 it was the third-largest smartphone maker in China at the end of the June 2023 quarter, with a market share of 16%, according to Counterpoint Research. Overall, the Chinese market contributes 19% to Apple's topline. However, Wedbush Securities\u2019 analyst Dan Ives thinks the concerns are overblown. \"I think this bark is worse than the bite. The Chinese consumer continues to want iPhones, and we believe there are 80-90 million of those in an upgrade opportunity,\" he said in a CNBC interview.

Spotify, looking to bolster its profitability, is eyeing the growing audiobook market alongside its core music streaming business.\u00a0 This move follows Spotify's recent premium individual plan price hike to $10.99 monthly in\u00a0several major markets. Spotify ventured into the audiobook space a year ago, offering a catalog of over 300,000 titles from various authors and publishers.\u00a0 However, the initial approach was based on a pay-per-download model. To compete with\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), Spotify directed users to purchase through a web browser to avoid Apple's 30% commission.\u00a0 The new test program seeks to enhance user experience by allowing subscribers to access free audiobooks directly in the Spotify app. The pilot program will likely roll out gradually in English-speaking countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the U.K. While the exact audiobook titles are still being determined, Spotify aims to provide a broad selection to its subscribers.\u00a0 Spotify's previous acquisitions, such as Findaway and agreements with services like Storytel, have paved the way for its expansion into the audiobook market. Spotify is exploring multiple initiatives to boost revenue. It includes adding\u00a0full-length music videos\u00a0to its app to compete with\u00a0Alphabet Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0YouTube, and\u00a0ByteDance Ltd's TikTok,\u00a0including a move to put lyrics\u00a0behind its paywall.

What Happened: As Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reported on Friday, the upcoming\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) timepiece series will undergo notable enhancements. Although the models will retain their present size and design, they will soon sport new materials and colors.

Reports suggest that the Pixel 8 price could be hiked by \u20ac150, while the Pixel 8 Pro could cost \u20ac200 more. While this is European pricing, whether Google will announce a price hike in the US remains to be seen.

Better Display: The standard Pixel 8 is said to get a display upgrade \u2013 instead of the 90Hz refresh rate like the Pixel 7, the Pixel 8 is expected to support a 120Hz refresh rate. This should help in improved user experience thanks to smoother animations. Camera Upgrades: Google is expected to use a new 50MP ultrawide angle camera sensor in the Pixel 8 series, up from the 12MP resolution of the Pixel 7 series. The primary sensor will also see a generation upgrade from GN1 on the Pixel 7 to GN2 in the Pixel 8 series. The GN2 sensor is said to capture 35% more light, which should result in better-quality images. Design Improvements: Google could implement subtle design changes \u2013 the Pixel 8's camera visor design on the back is expected to see most of these changes. Google's Pixel 8 Pro leak suggests that the back will sport a unified camera visor design instead of splitting off the depth sensor like on the Pixel 7. Longer Support: Google will reportedly offer up to five years of software updates, catching up to Apple's iPhones. As a result, Pixel 8 users can expect software updates for five years from the launch date, as against only three years on the Pixel 7 series and earlier. Bigger Batteries: The Pixel 8 is expected to see a 5% higher battery capacity than the Pixel 7. It is also expected to support faster 24W wired charging compared to Pixel 7\u2019s 20W support.

                "body": "Alphabet Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0Google, bracing for its\u00a0upcoming antitrust trial, has suffered a significant setback with the departure of former FTC Commissioner and legal scholar Joshua Wright. The search giant cut ties with Wright after he faced a barrage of sexual harassment allegations, including complaints from eight women.\u00a0 The allegations ranged from flirtatious texts to claims of sexual relationships, causing Google to sever its association with him, the New York Post\u00a0reports. Also Read:\u00a0FTC Chair Lina Khan's Impact? Amazon Hires Dozens of Former FTC Officials Key Antitrust Voice Exits Wright had played a crucial role in Google's legal and public relations strategy in preparation for the trial, scheduled to commence in federal court in Washington next week.\u00a0 Insiders revealed that Google had plans to deploy him to challenge the Department of Justice, author op-eds, and work behind the scenes as their key antitrust advocate. \u00a0Wright's departure leaves Google without a prominent figure in its antitrust defense. Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department alleged Google's breach of antitrust law to build and maintain its search dominance.\u00a0 The DOJ prosecuted Google in 2020 for exploiting its influence to eliminate rivals. Google drew other antitrust complaints involving dominance of the digital advertising business and Play Store.\u00a0 Global regulatory authorities even proposed divesting Google's services to end its\u00a0influence over rivals. Wright had received substantial advising fees from clients, including Google and\u00a0Amazon.Com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0AMZN). Additionally, major tech companies had donated significantly to George Mason Law School, where he taught.\u00a0 Throughout his career, Wright authored numerous articles emphasizing the perils of breaking up monopolies.\u00a0 He contended that the U.S. housed the world's most successful companies due to its competition laws. However, he cautioned that altering the existing framework could jeopardize this status, potentially marking the end of an era.\u00a0 This development comes at a challenging time for Google, which already faces federal allegations of using illegal deals with smartphone manufacturers, including\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), to establish a search engine monopoly.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, META, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is currently trading below our pivotal 445.08 mark. For a bullish scenario, we're eyeing a recovery above 445.08. A strong bullish indication would be a surge above 446.31, establishing it as support. A further climb could lead to 447.94. Our high target for SPY today stands at 449.42. If SPY fails to sustain above 445.08, we anticipate a bearish move towards 443.90 and then 443.42. Should selling intensify and 443.42 doesn't hold, our bearish target is 442.61. In the case of significant sell-offs, our low target for SPY today is 441.06. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) experienced a dip overnight and are now hovering around our 371.96 benchmark. For bullish momentum, we're aiming for 372.91. If buying continues, 373.82 should be the next target, serving as a support. For a dominant bullish day, we're watching for activity above 373.82. A strong buying surge could propel the price to 375.18, with an ultimate bullish target of 375.98. If selling persists, bears might push towards 370.91. A failure to maintain above this could lead to a further drop to 370.08. A breach of this level could see the price descending to 369.39, with our most bearish target for the day at 368.57. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen a dip overnight but is trading above our 177.31 benchmark. For bullish momentum, we're hoping for 177.31 to hold as support, with a rally towards 178.18 and then 178.61. If the bullish trend continues, we could see prices reaching 179.36. For a dominant bullish day for Apple, we're aiming for 180.60, with an ultimate bullish target of 181.25. If 177.31 doesn't hold, a bearish move towards 176.84 is anticipated.

For a bullish outlook, we're aiming for a recovery above 331.24. If this level holds as support, we could see a rally towards 333.46. A strong bullish move could lead to 335.96, with our day's high target at 337.80. If 331.24 doesn't hold, a bearish descent towards 328.52 is likely.

For bullish momentum, we're hoping for 134.96 to hold as support, with a rally towards 136.29. A bullish rally could bring the price to our day's high target of 137.79.

Further selling could push prices to 135.39, with our most bearish target for the day at 134.60. Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) is hovering around our 250.25 benchmark. For bullish momentum, we're hoping for 250.25 to hold as support, with a rally towards 252.38. A strong bullish trend could lead to our day's high target of 254.28.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is \ud83d\udd12.\u00a0It is a Friday.\u00a0On Fridays, moves tend to be exaggerated in whichever direction the market starts going.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

Broader indexes represented by\u00a0SPDR S&P 500\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) and\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) lost close to 2% this week. Meanwhile, Nvidia's former acquisition target\u00a0Arm Ltd\u00a0shared ambitious forecasts driven by the demand for chips in data centers and AI.\u00a0 The\u00a0Softbank Group Corp\u00a0(OTC:\u00a0SFTBF) (OTC:\u00a0SFTBY)\u00a0backed chip designer projected an 11% revenue growth for the current fiscal year and over 20% growth in FY25, driven by the demand for chips in\u00a0data centers and AI.\u00a0 It eyes long-term operating margins of 60% as it braces for its initial public offering (IPO), with ambitions to raise $4.87 billion. Susquehanna\u00a0analyst Christopher Rolland endorsed Arm's premium valuation almost at par with Nvidia, citing Arm's expected compound annual revenue growth of 20% through to FY27 and improving operating margins.\u00a0 He expects Arm to achieve a more diversified revenue mix, including cloud computing and higher automotive market\u00a0share. The analyst sees continued opportunities for core improvements, driving up license fees and chip ASPs. Rolland also flagged Arm's designs come at a fraction of the cost of developing original intellectual property backed by a global community of software developers familiar with its designs. Also, Nvidia collaborated with Indian business tycoon\u00a0Mukesh Ambani's\u00a0Reliance Industries, marking Reliance Jio Infocomm and Reliance Industries' telecom's\u00a0foray into AI.\u00a0 The partnership follows Nvidia chief Jensen Huang's meeting with the Indian Prime Minister this week, which fueled speculations of Nvidia setting up a GPU and artificial intelligence\u00a0chip factory in India. Jio Platforms boasts of a staggering user base and acquisition of the lion's share in India's\u00a0$19 billion 5G spectrum license. The trillion-dollar U.S. chip designer lost over 7% this week.

                "body": "Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock got a boost from\u00a0Morgan Stanley's\u00a0re-rating. Analyst Erik W Woodring reiterated an Overweight rating with a\u00a0price target of $215. Apple's -6% stock move in the last two trading days looks unwarranted relative to the 4% revenue and 3% EPS downside (~20c) if Apple were to cede all of the share it has gained from\u00a0Huawei Technologies Co, Ltd\u00a0in the high end ($500+ ASP) Chinese smartphone market over the last three years, or about 18 million units (~40% of Apple's T12M China\u00a0iPhone\u00a0shipments).\u00a0 However, the analyst believes the market is hinting at something broader.\u00a0China could potentially\u00a0be on the path to becoming more nationalistic, which would put over $30 billion of operating profit (over 20% of AAPL's total operating profit) at risk should China decide to limit Apple's access to the Chinese market.\u00a0 The analyst justifies market overextrapolation, citing that supply constraints will significantly limit Huawei's 5G smartphone shipments. While China is critical to Apple's success, Apple is also essential for the Chinese economy.\u00a0 Interestingly, Apple is also vital to China's economy, employing millions of Chinese workers through device production and app development, and has helped build an entire supply chain.\u00a0 Therefore, Apple's recent stock move is indeed overdone as it implies Apple loses ~70% of its\u00a0iPhone\u00a0shipments in China, a highly draconian and unlikely scenario.\u00a0 Since Huawei's restrictions in 2019, Apple has gained ~20 points of China's premium smartphone share and now commands 60% of the market, while Huawei has lost ~35 points of premium share, resulting in just a 15% market share. Huawei's re-emergence into the 5G smartphone market is not a material downside risk as Apple's ecosystem in China remains very strong, Huawei smartphone volumes will likely be relatively small, and chip supply remains a gating factor, with the potential for further restrictions to the Huawei supply chain. Price Action:\u00a0AAPL shares traded higher by 1.13% at $179.76 on the last check Thursday.",

Resilient US Economy Bolsters Interest Rate Prospects: The U.S. economy demonstrated resilience as the ISM Services PMI for August exceeded expectations, marking the strongest service sector expansion in six months.\u00a0 Both the U.S. Dollar and Treasury yields rose further this week as investors revised their forecasts regarding the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate stance.

Remarkably, the U.S. Dollar Index surged past 105 levels, the highest since early March 2023, notching its eighth consecutive week of gains, its longest winning streak since 2014.

(NASDAQ:QCOM) fell over 8% for the week, marking the largest weekly loss in a year.  Tech\u2019s weaker performance led to a 1.6% decline in the S&P 500 and a 2.6% decline in the Nasdaq 100 Index for the week. Blue-chip stocks on the Dow Jones fell 0.9%, while small caps in the Russell 2000 tumbled 3%.  In contrast, the energy sector continued to excel, with Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) and Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) among the top-performing S&P 500 stocks for the week.  Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) posted high single-digit gains for the week, the most among Nasdaq 100 components, after company\u2019s inclusion in the S&P 500.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to unveil its latest innovations, including the much-anticipated iPhone 15 series, at its \"Wonderlust\" event scheduled for September 12. What Happened: The event\u00a0promises to showcase not just the new iPhone lineup but also updates to the Apple Watch and AirPods, along with\u00a0upcoming software updates. At the forefront of the unveiling is the iPhone 15 Pro line, which is expected to be the star of the show. The tech giant is also gearing up to introduce\u00a0advancements in iOS 17, iPadOS 17\u00a0and watchOS 10. \u00a0 The event is crucial as the iPhone, Apple Watch\u00a0and AirPods collectively constitute about 60% of Apple's total revenue, not accounting for the earnings from digital services such as Apple Music, Bloomberg reported. Among the notable changes that are expected to be revealed, Apple is transitioning the iPhone's charging and data port to the USB-C standard, enhancing its performance albeit potentially displeasing some consumers. The\u00a0modification marks the second alteration to the iPhone's port since its inception, the previous one being in 2012. The iPhone 15 series will reportedly come in four different versions: the base models iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, and the more premium iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. The Pro versions, specifically,\u00a0have undergone a\u00a0design overhaul, adopting titanium sides instead of stainless steel,\u00a0making them more resilient and lighter. Also Read:\u00a0Apple's $3 Trillion Crown Slips As Disappointing Sales Take Toll Another significant enhancement is the incorporation of the Dynamic Island interface in the non-Pro models, a feature introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro models last year, according to Bloomberg.\u00a0 The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are reportedly\u00a0upgrading to a 48-megapixel main camera sensor, aligning with the resolution of the previous year's iPhone 14 Pro's main camera. The Pro models will also retain a trio of cameras, boasting new telephoto and ultrawide lenses with increased megapixels. The iPhone 15 Pro Max, on the other hand, will have\u00a0a revamped telephoto system that doubles the hardware zoom capabilities from 3X to approximately 6X magnification. On the Apple Watch front, the focus remains on enhancing performance, with significant strides made in processing speed\u00a0facilitated by a new chip. The watches will also reportedly\u00a0inherit the U2 ultrawide-band chip, promising improved \"Find My\" functionalities. As for the AirPods, the shift to USB-C charging aligns with the changes introduced in the iPhone series. While no substantial hardware alterations are expected, a software update promises features like improved automatic device switching and a Conversation Awareness feature that intuitively silences media when a conversation is initiated, according to Bloomberg.\u00a0 Now Read:\u00a0Apple Will Permanently Delete Your Photos\u00a0\u2014 Here's How To Keep Them Safe This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

The week began with WTI crude hitting a 10-month high of over $85 a barrel due to Saudi Arabia and Russia's decision to extend production cuts through 2023, sparking inflation and interest rate concerns. Concurrently, the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields rose as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve's moves. While a September rate pause is likely, there's a 42% probability of a November rate increase. Benzinga provides daily reports on\u00a0the stocks most popular with investors.

                "body": "Each week, Benzinga Buzz compiles the latest entertainment news into a cohesive column for your consideration. Read on for the latest updates \u2014 both useful and irreverent. There's an old saying that's usually attributed to former President Abraham Lincoln, but\u00a0I think it appears originally in Maurice Switzer's \"Mrs. Goose, Her Book,\" and it goes like this: \"It is better to remain silent at the risk of being thought a fool, than to talk and remove all doubt of it.\" Well, this week, Slate.com's Dan Kois learned that the hard way. Sort of. He didn't talk. But he wrote\u00a0\u2014 a hit piece on beloved comedian Martin Short. With just one headline and deck \u2014 \"Why We Keep Putting Up With Martin Short: Is the 'Only Murders in the Building' star a comic genius or the most annoying actor on Earth?\" \u2014 Kois managed to unite the always pensive and never surly Twitter-verse (now \"X-verse\") around a common enemy: himself. The speed at which readers likely dropped off Slate after the first graph and responded with an angry tweet must've been astounding. For all our \"deep divisions,\" journalist Judy Woodruff noted this year, Americans \"have always found a way to come back together, through a civil war, or a century later, the protests of the 1960s or the war in Vietnam.\" Now, Martin Short can be added to that list. Someone should check on Kois to make sure he's OK after receiving what can only be described as a 21st-century lashing for his unpopular opinion. Some hot takes should be left on ice. I'm assuming Dan Kois is the guy who said Margot Robbie isn't attractive pic.twitter.com/tliUriM7C9 Looking forward to Dan Kois's next article for Slate: Martin Scorsese Is Actually a Shitty Filmmaker yesterday i texted a friend complaining that the stakes of writing a bad essay are too high, everyone should calm down about them and give writers more space to be wrong etc. well i fuckin take it back https://t.co/3LbbFl73XH This is not 'I don't like that taco place' writing a scathing op-ed can have an impact on someone's career. I don't know this writer is but they seem to just have damaged their own career.\r\nMartin, though, is a classic. pic.twitter.com/utNLnz9XSd Seeing the asshole that wrote this vile shit about Martin Short get dragged by the entire internet today has been really wonderful.

                "title": "Apple Could Emerge Unscathed From China Ban, Says Munster, As He Details Plan B For Averting Any Potential Impact",
                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock lost 6.4% over two sessions this week before recovering on Friday, with much of the weakness attributable to China's decision to ban iPhones from government offices and companies that work closely with the government. Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster on Friday weighed in on the potential impact of the ban for Apple. What Happened: The China ban will likely reduce Apple's overall revenue by about 1% in 2024, Munster said in a note. The fund manager said Beijing's move is driven by a desire for increased national security. \u201cWe believe China is still supportive of Apple's brand based on social media posts in the country that are influenced by the government,\u201d he said. The average Apple device owner in China loves their Apple products just like customers around the world and most of them wouldn't care whether there is a government ban, he added. Munster said he does not expect a hit to Apple's brand loyalty in China. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock Apple's Plan B: As U.S.-China relations sour, India could become an important part of Apple\u2019s growth, Munster said. \u201cWhen it comes to the Apple growth story, the company needs new big markets to go after to sustain a 5-10% revenue growth over the next 7 years (until 2030),\u201d he said. Munster pointed to Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about India during the June quarter earnings call. At the time, Cook said that India clocked a June quarter revenue record and saw double-digit revenue growth, while two new Apple stores that opened in the country beat expectations.  Can India Move The Needle? Munster estimated that India now accounts for 3% or roughly $12 billion of Apple's sales and it is growing by 20-25% year-over-year. In the long term, the country\u2019s makeup of sales should equal that of China, which currently contributes to about 20% or $80 billion of the company\u2019s revenue, he said. If India could go to $80 billion in revenue in seven years, the country alone can add an additional 2 to 3% to annual revenue growth, Munster said. \u201cAs China moves away from the West, India is likely to be a beneficiary, which should increase per capita GDP,\u201d the fund manager said. \u201cThat shift will take many years, and that rising tide should help offset a falling tide in China.\u201d Apple ended Friday\u2019s session up 0.35% at $178.18, according to Benzinga Pro data.

One analyst, however, said he sees the Huawei threat as good news for consumers. The initial batch of Huawei's Mate 60 Pro, priced at $960, reportedly sold out within hours of the commencement of presale, and interested customers have continued to place orders for future purchases. \u201cIt can force Apple to step out of its comfort zone and innovate more aggressively,\u201d said Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at Taiwan-based TFI Securities, on X on Friday, while noting that the two standard iPhone 15 models are the first smartphones to adopt stacked CIS.  CIS is a low-power imaging device with a complementary metal oxide-semiconductor, or CMOS, structure, which converts light energy into electrical energy to create images, and functions similar to film in a camera. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock Kuo said that, if there had been no U.S. ban, Huawei would have been the first smartphone brand to adopt stacked CIS, and that the adoption would have happened before 2023.

                "title": "Apple's Premium iPhones To See Price Hike in Select Markets, Says Gurman: How Cupertino Attracts Users To Pricier Models Amid Tough Economic Environment",
                "body": "Ahead of Apple, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 launch event, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman delved into a strategy that the company has implemented with much success. Apple\u2019s Strategy Shift: Apple will look to boost iPhone revenue by going upscale, said Gurman in his weekly Power-On newsletter. This is a strategy, the company first contemplated in 2016 when iPhone unit sales plateaued to around 200 million to 220 million devices annually, he said.  The iPhone X launched in 2017 was priced at $999, deemed hefty at that time, and followed up with a larger iPhone XS Max with 512 gigabytes of storage for $1,449 a year later, Gurman noted. This strategy worked as despite the unit sales remaining stagnant for the past seven years, revenue has grown about $70 billion, he said. \u201cThe shift also brought a change in the way Apple measures success. It stopped reporting\u00a0device unit sales in fiscal 2019, focusing instead on how much money each product brings in,\u201d Gurman said. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock Will Apple Stick To Plan?  Gurman said he expects the price of top-end iPhones to increase in select markets, thanks to more expensive components like titanium frames, new camera sensors and additional storage. \u201cThe niceties will give users more reasons than ever to splurge on Apple's priciest phones,\u201d he said. Apple will differentiate its iPhone 15 Pro models from the standard models by giving them better battery life, faster USB-C data transfer speeds, \u00a0thinner borders and nicer screens, Gurman said. The Pro versions also will get a customizable action button and a faster chip, he added. These features could make the $200-to-$300 gap between the regular iPhone and the Pro model worth for some customers, the Apple writer said. If the company promotes the difference as only $10-$15 more a month on instalments, the price bump may not matter much, he said. Apple will differentiate between the two top-end models, with a wider range of optical zoom via a so-called periscope lens in the Pro Max model, the Apple writer said. The new approach shows Apple is getting more aggressive with its premium strategy, he said. Gurman also expects the company to push customers toward its more expensive accessories. The new Apple Watches will all get a major performance upgrade, but users will need to opt for the pricier Ultra to get a titanium case, larger screen and longer battery life and if customers want AirPods that support USB-C charging, they'll need to buy the costlier model, at least for now, he said. \u201cFor Apple, the hope is that a feature-packed (and pricier) iPhone lineup will help the company weather any challenges,\u201d the columnist said.

                "body": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) faced a challenging week with the looming threat of competition from Huawei and a limited ban in China, just ahead of its much-anticipated\u00a0\u201cWonderlust\u201d iPhone 15 launch\u00a0event. A Forgettable Week:\u00a0Apple\u2019s stock had been on an upward trajectory since the lackluster performance in 2022, gaining momentum until July this year.\u00a0 However, like many other tech stocks, it faced a period of weakness as sentiment towards growth stocks soured, driven by expectations of further rate hikes by the\u00a0Federal Reserve. A higher interest rate environment, especially detrimental to consumer-focused tech companies like Apple, often prompts buyers to hold back on discretionary purchases. Additionally, investors tend to shift their preferences towards safer investments like treasuries, seeking their safe-haven appeal and attractive returns. The stock hit a low point in late August but was showing signs of recovery, bolstered by positive expectations surrounding the upcoming iPhone 15 launch event. It was precisely at this juncture that a double blow struck the stock hard, resulting in a significant 6.4% pullback on Wednesday and Thursday, causing a staggering $189.8 billion loss in market capitalization. Chart Courtesy of TradingView See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock Mixed Views:\u00a0The sell-off in Apple shares is seen by some as a knee-jerk reaction. Apple bull and Wedbush analyst\u00a0Daniel Ives\u00a0downplayed the China news, estimating that the government ban would impact a maximum of around 500,000 iPhones. He pointed out that Apple is a major employer in China, considering its extensive supply chain partnerships within the country. Deepwater Asset Management\u2018s\u00a0Gene Munster\u00a0shared a similar perspective, suggesting that the ban might reduce iPhone sales by 2% and overall revenue by 1% in 2024. On the other hand,\u00a0BofA\u2018s\u00a0Wamsi Mohan\u00a0expressed concerns about a potential 5 million to 10 million-unit headwind for Apple due to the ban. He also highlighted the competition posed by\u00a0Huawei, emphasizing that if Huawei reclaims 10 million units from Apple in China, it could lead to an EPS headwind of $0.11. Huawei\u2019s recent success with the Mate 60 Pro, which sold out within hours of preorders opening, adds to the competitive pressure. Uncertainty Ahead:\u00a0Looking ahead, Apple\u2019s stock typically experiences gains leading up to an iPhone launch event, followed by a pullback after the event. Here\u2019s how that trend has fared over the past five years. While some attribute this to the \u201cbuy-the-rumor, sell-the-news\u201d phenomenon, others point out that recent iPhone releases have not introduced significantly groundbreaking features, potentially leading to post-launch disappointment. Apple is expected to continue its strategy of prioritizing value over volume, focusing\u00a0on enhancing high-end models\u00a0with compelling features. This approach aims to appeal to consumers in a global economy marked by macroeconomic risks. However, it\u2019s important to note that China remains a pivotal component of Apple\u2019s growth narrative, serving as both a major supplier and market for its products. Therefore, market participants and analysts will closely monitor developments in this crucial market. Closing Note:\u00a0On Friday, Apple\u2019s stock closed with a 0.35% gain, reaching $178.18, according to\u00a0data from Benzinga Pro.

                "title": "Will iPhone 15 Be A Meaningful Upgrade? KeyBanc Analyst Weighs In On Main Features, Carrier Deals",
                "body": "With the iPhone 15 launch just a day away, expectations and rumors concerning the next iteration of Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) flagship hardware device are coming in thick and fast. In a note published on Monday, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh weighed in on various aspects of the newest iPhone. Meaningful Upgrade: Vinh expects the iPhone\u00a015 to represent a meaningful upgrade cycle from a features perspective, with key upgrades in Pro series models likely to be: The analyst also expects the regular iPhone 15/15 Plus to have feature upgrades such as the A16 processor, dynamic island, and USB-C port. Despite the major upgrades, builds will likely be down by 4% year-over-year in the second half versus the iPhone 14 series, Vinh said. He blamed it on the lower CIS yields at supply chain partner Sony. See Also: Apple\u2019s Value Plummets $190B In 2 Days: Is iPhone Launch Week Always Troubled? Price Hike In The Offing?\u00a0 KeyBanc has not factored in the level of price increases suggested by reports, which have called for a $200 price increase for the Pro Max model to $1,299 and a $100 increase for the Pro variant to $1,099, Vinh said. The firm expects the unit average selling prices to move higher in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, he added. \u201cIf a price increase does occur, we believe there could be some modest demand destruction toward high-end devices, and mix, which has shifted toward ~50% high end, to shift back toward the \u201cPlus\u201d and standard model,\u201d  the analyst said. Vinh, however, said a price increase is not justifiable, as consumers may not find the features meaningfully different. Some of the features such as the USB-C Vs. Lightning Port could turn consumers away, he said.\u00a0 Also, demand in the U.S. is likely to be relatively soft, given upgrade activity and the macro environment, he added. US Carrier Promotions: Vinh noted that T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) and AT&T, Inc. (NYSE:T) aggressively promoted the iPhone 14, offering their best deals to new and existing customers, Verizon, Inc. (NYSE:VZ) offered only an \"iPhone 14 on US\" to new customers. The analyst said a muted promotional environment is likely, where the best deals are provided to new customers resulting in lower upgrade rates from the U.S. Carriers. Vinh maintained an Overweight rating and a $200 price target for Apple shares. Apple shares rose 0.84% to $179.67 in premarket trading on Monday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

                "body": "The soon-to-be-launched Apple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 Pro models are set to be considerably lighter due to a change in materials used, while the base model iPhone 15 will retain similar dimensions and weight to its forerunner. What Happened: MacRumors obtained the specific dimensions and weights of the iPhone 15 range on Friday.\u00a0The iPhone 15 Pro is\u00a0forecasted to be up to 10%\u00a0lighter than the iPhone 14\u00a0Pro, largely due to the replacement of the previously used stainless steel with a new Grade 5 titanium midframe. The standard iPhone 15 is expected to sport the same dimensions and weight as the iPhone 14, with no significant alterations in materials or structure. The iPhone 15 Plus is also predicted to closely resemble its predecessor in terms of size and weight. Despite the reduction in weight,\u00a0the iPhone 15 Pro is\u00a0likely to have a slightly thicker form factor\u00a0than the iPhone 14 Pro.\u00a0However, this increase in thickness might be compensated by a smaller bezel size, thanks to the incorporation of LIPO technology in the display. The iPhone 15 Pro Max\u00a0is also predicted to be lighter, by 19 grams,\u00a0than the iPhone 14 Pro\u00a0Max. The weight difference is ascribed to\u00a0the change in materials, rather\u00a0than any\u00a0significant structural changes or design\u00a0differences. See Also:\u00a0Google Pixel 8 Launch Confirmed For October 4: Features, Price, And Everything We Know So Far The data provided by MacRumors is based on pre-production units and may not be an exact reflection of the final mass production units. However, it does provide valuable insights into what to expect from the iPhone 15 series. Why It Matters: The anticipated changes in the iPhone 15 Pro models come in the wake of reports suggesting a significant price hike for the new devices. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models are expected to cost at least $100 more than the current models. The iPhone 15 series is set to hit store shelves globally this month, with India likely to receive the new models simultaneously with the rest of the world. In the run-up to the launch,\u00a0analysts from Morgan Stanley and Wedbush\u00a0have shared their expectations, predicting limited upgrades\u00a0for the iPhone 15 and\u00a015 Plus models but substantial changes for the Pro models. However, the launch week has not been without challenges for\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), which saw its value drop by $190B in just two days due to competition threats and a limited ban in China, as\u00a0reported by Benzinga.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly planning to phase out the iPhone mini models with the launch of the iPhone 15, which is set for unveiling this week. What Happened: Renowned Apple analyst, Mark Gurman, recently hinted at the dwindling inventory of iPhone 13 mini in a tweet. He also reported that Apple\u2019s stock of other products, including\u00a0Apple Watch Ultras, Watch bands,\u00a0leather cases, and MagSafe wallets,\u00a0is running low. The tech giant is anticipated to\u00a0drop the prices of several\u00a0older iPhone models by $100 to coincide with the new release. The iPhone 13 mini, however, may be on the chopping block post the iPhone 15 event. Rumors suggest that the \u2018mini\u2019 size could vanish from Apple\u2019s product range this year. See Also:\u00a0iPhone 15 Pro To Be 10% Lighter Than The 14 Pro Despite Similar Size, Thanks To This Upgrade This could indicate that Apple may not restock these items after Tuesday\u2019s event. The first-gen Apple Watch Ultra is also expected to be phased out with the launch of a second generation this year. While the future\u00a0of the iPhone 13 mini\u00a0remains uncertain, the iPhone 13 is expected to still be available for purchase post the event, possibly at a discounted price of\u00a0$599 with carrier offers ($629\u00a0unlocked). Why does it matter: The potential\u00a0discontinuation of the iPhone 13\u00a0mini suggests that the era of compact iPhones might be winding down. The current alternative, iPhone SE 3, features an older design without Face ID. Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Just when investors thought they'd parted ways, Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have surprised everyone, joining forces in a three-year deal over 5G chips.  Apple\u2019s pivot back to Qualcomm seems to be a clear indicator that its quest to whip up its own 5G chips might not be going as swimmingly as hoped, as the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Historically, this relationship has been a goldmine for Qualcomm and, well, a bit of a money pit for Apple. Last year, Apple\u2019s modem buys accounted for 16% of Qualcomm's earnings \u2013 that\u2019s $7.26 billion.  Despite these riches, Qualcomm's shares have taken a nosedive, down 20% this past year, thanks to a general cooling towards smartphones. The terms of this new deal, however, are being played close to the vest. Qualcomm Inc. shares were up 3.6% during early trading on Monday, according to Benzinga Pro. QUALCOMM Inc.

In 2019, Apple made a hefty $1 billion acquisition of Intel\u2019s smartphone-modem enterprise, assimilating over 2,200 personnel and a vast patent treasury. Yet, Intel\u2019s tribulations in perfecting 5G modems \u2013 that led them to hemorrhage approximately $1 billion annually \u2013 might be indicative of the challenges Apple is grappling with. But, like Intel before them who bled a billion annually on 5G struggles, Apple seems to be finding the 5G scene tougher than expected. Curiously, this partnership renewal has been announced just as Apple is about to pull the curtain on its newest products this week \u2013 the iPhone 15, not to mention fresh-from-the-oven Apple Watches and AirPods. With sales having hit a bit of a rough patch recently, these launches are crucial. And let's not forget, the iPhone remains Apple's golden goose, raking in roughly half of their total revenue.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is \ud83d\udd12.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "body": "In the ever-evolving tech landscape, the dynamic between industry giants\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) and\u00a0Alphabet Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0Google\u00a0has been a mix of fierce competition and strategic collaboration.\u00a0 Over the years, their interactions have encompassed intense rivalry, epitomized by Steve Jobs' famous \"thermonuclear war\" threat over Google's foray into smartphones and enthusiastic cooperation.\u00a0 Since 2005, Google has paid Apple substantial sums to secure its position as the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser. A trove of internal communications has surfaced as part of the U.S. Department of Justice's\u00a0antitrust case against\u00a0Google, Bloomberg\u00a0reports. The trial, set to last ten weeks, primarily focuses on Google's alleged monopoly in the online search market.\u00a0 If the Justice Department prevails, it may seek to separate Alphabet's search business from other products, potentially resulting in a U.S. company's most significant forced breakup since\u00a0AT&T Inc's\u00a0(NYSE:T) dissolution in 1984.\u00a0 Regardless of the outcome, the trial could have repercussions for Google and its business partners, including Apple, whose executives will testify. The Justice Department and 52 state attorneys general accuse Google of maintaining its search monopoly through agreements with tech rivals, smartphone manufacturers, and wireless providers.\u00a0 Among these deals, the agreement with Apple stands out. It began 18 years ago, making Google Apple's default search engine and giving it a significant share of the ad revenue generated from Safari browser searches.\u00a0 While Google's market share surged to 90%, Apple reaped billions annually from this partnership. Amazon.Com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is also under inquiry of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over preferential treatment of its products on its platforms and\u00a0third-party seller treatment.\u00a0 The FTC has also investigated Amazon for potential anticompetitive conduct over its marketplace, Prime subscription service, and cloud computing.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, and META. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is hovering around our pivotal level of 447.94. For a bullish outlook, maintaining above 447.94 is crucial. A strong bullish indication would be a surge above 449.42, establishing it as support. If momentum persists, we might see it reach 450.23. The day's optimistic target for SPY is 451.01. Should 447.94 fail as a support, anticipate a bearish descent to 446.31. If selling intensifies and 446.31 doesn't hold, the next bearish target is 445.08. In case of significant bearish pressure, the day's pessimistic target for SPY is 443.90. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) are trading near our crucial level of 375.18. For bullish momentum, sustaining above 375.18 is vital. If buying continues, bulls aim to secure 375.98 as support. A dominant bullish day would involve trading above 375.98, potentially reaching 377.58. The day's bullish target is 378.93. If selling persists, bears might challenge the 373.82 support. A failure to maintain above 373.82 could lead to a drop to 372.91. If that doesn't hold, the next level to watch is 371.96. The day's bearish target is 370.91. Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading above our marker of 179.36. Bulls hope to keep 179.36 as support, aiming for 180.60. If bullishness continues, the next target is 181.25, with an ultimate bullish goal for the day at 182.27. If 179.36 falters as support, anticipate a dip to 178.61 or 178.18. Intense selling might push it down to 177.31, with the day's bearish target at 176.84. Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading slightly below our 335.96 marker. Bulls aim for an ascent to 337.80, hoping to establish it as support. If bullishness persists, the next target is 339.02, with an optimistic end-of-day target at 341.41. If 335.96 doesn't hold, anticipate a bearish move to 333.46. A breach there could lead to 331.24, with the day's bearish target at 328.52. After an overnight gap up, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0is around 262.68. Bulls hope to maintain this as support, targeting 264.46 next. Strong bullish activity might push it to 266.83, with the day's bullish target at 269.48. If 262.68 doesn't hold, bears might aim for 259.81, then 257.56, with a bearish day's end target of 254.28. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is hovering around the 458.20 mark. For those bullish on the stock, holding this as a foundation and aiming for 461.49 is the strategy. Should 489.04 be secured again, the optimistic projection for the day's close is 464.95. On the flip side, if 458.20 is compromised, bearish sentiments could drive the price towards 454.09, and if the decline continues, 450.04. The most pessimistic forecast for the day stands at 447.05. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0current position is close to 138.76. For bullish traders, the goal is to solidify this as a base and set sights on 139.37. If momentum remains, the day could conclude around the bullish target of 140.52. Conversely, if support at 138.76 gives way, the bearish trajectory might lead to 138.03, and if the slide persists, 137.22. The day's lowest expected point is 135.97. Meta's\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) current stance is approximately 300.23. For those optimistic about its performance, the aim is to use this as a stepping stone and reach for 301.71. If the bullish trend continues, the day might wrap up around 304.77. However, if 300.23 fails to provide adequate support, the bearish path could lead to 297.33, and further decline might touch 295.97. The most conservative estimate for the day is 293.91. Final Word: Today's trading will be influenced by the volatility from index contract rollovers and consumer data at 11AM ET. Stay alert and trade wisely. Best of luck!

                "body": "Starting with S&P Weekly, I am a bit undecided at the moment. Last week we rejected a bearish imbalance to close out the week, and left open a bullish volume imbalance from the previous week. With CPI and PPI this week and not much else, I plan on treading lightly until price moves out of this range.   NQ pulled back quite a bit last week, as stated in the newsletter last Sunday. While I do still favor price moving towards 15100, the fact we almost perfectly held previous resistance as support led me to pump the brakes a bit. DXY will be my main watch for the week, which will help me make decisions on NQ. If you are unaware of the dollar's correlation, check out my YouTube channel for more.  DXY with a strong break and hold of buyside liquidity at 104.69 last week, using previous resistance from March as support. Next level I am watching is 105.88. If price moves below that 104.69 level, I'll feel much more comfortable with longs. If not, I will continue to tread lightly on long scalps and predominantly look for lower prices.  A very nice hold of 50% of the range and the bullish imbalance formed last week. Was this pullback enough or will ES see one of the lower volume imbalances?  NQ got into the bearish imbalance from Wednesday and pulled back immediately. Continuation would suggest movement down towards the volume imbalance below 15200...  DXY with one resistance level to beat until the next level of liquidity.  Zooming in to a 30 min chart, price closed pretty bullish, with a bullish market structure shift and bounce off the golden pocket 62-79% retracement. The question is how much of a bounce does this create? A few levels of resistance overhead, but until this shows its hand as bearish, I won't fight it. Again, pretty neutral until CPI...  AAPL\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0completed a 1 standard deviation move from the initial bearish market structure shift last week. Price is still a ways away from the 50% level of the initial range.  TSLA\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) maintains bullish market structure despite a pretty harsh sell off Friday. Relative equal lows below can get swept, which would also shift market structure back to the bears.  GOOGL (NASDAQ:GOOGL) a few cents from taking liquidity at 136.80. Bulls want to see the green box below current price hold for a next leg up.

The weekly jobless claims report and the August producer price inflation report are both due on Thursday, while the results of the September Empire State manufacturing survey, the University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for September, and the Federal Reserve's August industrials production report could also move the needle on the market.

                "title": "New Leak Reiterates Apple's iPhone 15 Pro Models Could Get RAM Boost to 8GB, But This Crucial Choice Remains Unchanged",
                "body": "With the\u00a0imminent launch\u00a0of\u00a0Apple Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhone 15\u00a0lineup scheduled within less than 24 hours, a new\u00a0leak has reiterated\u00a0a potential\u00a08GB RAM\u00a0update for the Pro models. However, it suggests that the models will maintain the status quo as far as storage options are concerned.\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0Apple has conducted extensive testing on the iPhone 15 Pro models, exploring various RAM and storage configurations, resulting in an anticipated RAM boost to 8GB,\u00a0reported\u00a0MacRumors.\u00a0 Having said that, Cupertino seems intent on keeping the storage options consistent with its previous models. See Also:\u00a0Apple\u2019s iPhone to Bear Brunt of US-China Tensions as the Asia Giant Looks to Extend Ban to State Agencies The latest report has dispelled\u00a0rumors of a 2TB storage variant, reaffirming the existing choices of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. This decision may disappoint users hoping for even more storage capacity. What\u2019s interesting is the uncertainty surrounding which specific Pro model might receive the 8GB RAM upgrade. Apple tested both 6GB and 8GB\u00a0LPDDR5 DRAM, leading to speculation that RAM capacity might be tied to storage options similar to the iPad Pro.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet, a previous report from Trendforce contradicted this, suggesting that all Pro models may uniformly receive 8GB of RAM. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0In August this year, a leaker who goes by the handle\u00a0@URedditor\u00a0on\u00a0X, formerly\u00a0Twitter, also spoke about Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro model tests\u00a0featuring the A17 Bionic chipset, offering both 6GB and 8GB RAM options.\u00a0 These tests reportedly included faster LPDDR5 RAM, boasting a 50% speed increase and up to 30% greater efficiency. Although expectations leaned toward the tech giant sticking with 6GB RAM, despite the last upgrade in 2020, recent developments suggest Apple acknowledges the demand for more memory, considering the 8GB RAM configuration.

                "body": "Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is all set to launch its next-generation iPhone 15 lineup today, and the models are expected to\u00a0come with higher price tags.\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0The latest iPhone models from Apple have generated considerable buzz ahead of their launch. The\u00a0price tags for these devices\u00a0have been a topic of speculation. With just hours left in the highly-anticipated launch, we have compiled all the rumors and reports so that you can be prepared for what amount to pay.\u00a0\u00a0 See Also:\u00a0iPhone 15 May Face Hurdle In China As Government Officials Receive Foreign Device Ban, Says Report iPhone 15: Starting From $799\u00a0 The entry-level\u00a0iPhone 15 is expected to be priced at $799. While this may not be budget-friendly, it remains the most accessible choice within the new lineup. iPhone 15 Plus: Starting From $899 The second non-pro iPhone 15 model will reportedly have no changes in its pricing and will be available at a starting price of $899.\u00a0 iPhone 15 Pro: Starting From $1,099 For those seeking more advanced features, the iPhone 15 Pro could come in at a starting price of $1,099. The iPhone 14 Pro costs $999. The Pro model has had a\u00a0starting price of $999\u00a0in the U.S. since its launch with the iPhone X in 2017. iPhone 15 Pro Max: Starting from $1,299 The iPhone 15 Pro Max, Apple\u2019s flagship model, is positioned at the top of the range with a reported\u00a0starting price of $1,299. It is important to mention that the iPhone 14 Pro Max costs $1,099. The \u2018Pro Max\u2019 iPhones have not yet seen a price hike since they were first introduced in 2018, but now multiple sources are expecting Apple to hike prices. Possible Price Increase for iPhone 15 Pro Max There\u2019s a possibility the iPhone 15 Pro Max\u2019s price could rise even higher, nearing the $2,000 mark. This increase is linked to rumors of a new top-tier two-terabyte storage option. Having said that, a new report has dispelled\u00a0rumors of a 2TB storage variant.\u00a0 How Apple Might Justify The Price Increase:\u00a0The\u00a0Tim Cook-led company could be banking on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max\u2019s offerings, including super slim bezels, Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, faster charging, and a titanium chassis, setting them apart from the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, which received relatively moderate upgrades. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0One key factor that may have influenced Apple\u2019s pricing decision is the sales performance of its previous models. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, while seeing an increase in sales in recent months, have\u00a0not met the company\u2019s expectations. Where To Watch The Launch:\u00a0Cupertino\u2019s \u201cWonderlust\u201d event, which will include the launch of the iPhone 15 lineup and the next iterations of its Apple Watch, is all set for today. According to the company\u2019s event page, the launch will kickstart at 1 p.m. EDT and broadcast from the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California. The event will be streamed on Apple.com and the Apple TV app.\u00a0 Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

It all comes down to how the Snapchat app interacts with different operating systems, according to Insider Tech.\u00a0 Given the extensive diversity of Android devices available in the market, each running different versions of OS software, Snapchat developers found it difficult to optimize the app for all Android smartphones, resulting in a lackluster user experience.

This approach ensures uniformity across a wide range of Android devices but, unfortunately, sacrifices image quality in the process. Although there are certain examples, including\u00a0Google Pixel 2, which leverages the device\u2019s camera for Snapchat, this remains an anomaly among Android smartphones.

                "body": "On the eve of Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"Wonderlust\" iPhone 15 launch event, Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster shared his take on what to expect from the event. What Happened: The event may \u201cfall flat\u201d for some investors looking for a surprise new product or some AI hype, said Munster in a series of posts X, formerly Twitter. The fund manager expects three material updates from the event. iPhone Features: The iPhone 15 Apple is expected to unveil at the event will include the typical camera improvements, faster chip and better battery, Munster said. He also expects two notable changes, namely titanium casing to make it lighter and a new programmable button similar to the Apple Watch. These incremental updates, though may seem insignificant, should be taken into context as to who the buyer is, Munster said. About 400 million+ iPhones are more than four years old and are likely candidates for upgrades, the tech analyst said, adding that for these buyers a move from the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 15 will be a significant upgrade. iPhone upgrades alone may help Apple beat Street estimates of about 220 million iPhone unit sales in 2024, he said.

For reference, here is the current iPhone lineup. pic.twitter.com/ii42H4MsCZ The iPhone lineup pricing ranges from $429 to $1,199 in essentially $100 increments and if Apple were to raise the price of just the new iPhone 15 models it would disrupt their established and highly effective pricing curve, Munster said. Alternatively, if Apple wants to hike prices and maintain the linearity of the pricing curve as well, it may have to raise the price of every phone by $100, he said. This, the analyst said would be a \u201crisky proposition\u201d in the current environment. But Apple has the leeway to increase prices by increasing the price of storage, the analyst said. \u201cIncremental storage has 90%+ gross margins compared to overall product gross margins of 36%,\u201d he said. Apple Watch: Munster expects incremental updates for the Apple Watch. Apple Watch Series 9 will likely include a faster chip for the first time since the Series 6, a better heart-rate monitor, and the new Ultra will likely be lighter, he said. The entry-level Apple Watch family price of $249 for the SE will likely go up by $50, the fund manager said. He expects the Watch growth to accelerate from 5% currently to 15%. Tweaks to AirPods and an iPad launch cannot be ruled out, he added Apple ended Monday's session at $179.66, up 0.66%, according to Benzinga Pro data.

                "title": "Here's Why Apple Took 8 Years To Bring USB-C To iPhone Despite Contributing To Its Development",
                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is widely expected to bring the much-requested USB-C port to the iPhone, with the iPhone 15 scheduled to launch on Tuesday. That said, Apple has been one of the major contributors to the development of the USB-C port, but it seems to have resisted its implementation on principle. What Happened: Apple helped develop the USB-C port eight years ago, along with industry major Intel. In fact, Apple was amongst the top contributors in terms of engineers assigned to the project, only behind Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Japan Aviations Electronics Industry, and Tyco Electronics Corp. See Also: What Will Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 Cost? Here Are Price Predictions From Base Model To Pro Max This was back in 2014, according to the official USB Implementers Forum documents. Apple assigned more engineers than even industry heavyweights like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nokia, and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, to name a few. After all, it has been one of the most requested features for several years now. Apple stuck to the Lightning port it launched with the iPhone 5 back in 2012, so there were no concerns about it haphazardly changing ports either. In fact, Apple was the first company to launch a laptop with a USB-C port \u2013 the 2015 MacBook featured this port. It also switched to this port on the 2020 iPad Air, so existing Apple products are already using it. But it persisted with Lightning on iPhones for 11 years. For context, the first Android phone with a USB-C port was the LeEco Le Max, a Chinese phone launched back in 2015. Why It Took Apple So Long To Switch: While it looks like Apple was being stubborn with the Lightning port on iPhones, the decision to do so could have been based on its principles and operating from a position of strength instead of giving into regulatory whims. Apple has previously underlined environmental concerns, stating that hundreds of millions of cables and accessories will become incompatible, adding to the e-waste and ending up in a landfill. Environmental concerns have also been Apple's reasoning behind ditching the charging adapter, a move many Android smartphone makers have since approved. Another reason is Apple doesn't want to be dictated to by governments. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Apple's SVP of worldwide marketing, Greg Joswiak, said it would help customers to \"not have a government be that prescriptive\". He also pointed out how regulatory prescriptions on technology norms can lack the foresight and expertise needed by citing that the European Union pushed for adopting micro-USB ports for several years before giving up. One of the benefits of the Lightning port is its reversible design \u2013 you don't have to look twice before plugging your iPhone in. In an era of micro-USB ports, this was an important advantage. However, USB-C took that advantage away from Lightning, and now, thanks to its wide adoption and EU rules, iPhone buyers will benefit this time around with Apple being forced to make the switch.

Haas stated in a video presentation for prospective investors, \"We made a significant shift in our strategy.\" Historically, Arm's primary focus has been designing chips for smartphones and other electronic devices, selling this technology inexpensively to companies like\u00a0Qualcomm Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0QCOM).\u00a0 However, Arm is now engaged in intricate design work tailored for specific products, focusing on key growth areas like mobile devices, cloud computing, automotive electronics, and IoT technology. The British chip designer eyes boosting the price range of its IPO after its share sale gets subscribed sixfold thanks to the artificial intelligence frenzy. Haas' pitch is integral to Arm's ambitious valuation target of up to $54.5 billion in its\u00a0IPO\u00a0this week, a substantial increase from the $32 billion\u00a0SoftBank Corp\u00a0(OTC:\u00a0SFTBF) (OTC:\u00a0SFTBY) paid for Arm in 2016.\u00a0 The video presentation includes endorsements from\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA)\u00a0CEO Jensen Huang\u00a0and\u00a0James Hamilton, the architect behind much of\u00a0Amazon.com Inc's\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0AMZN)\u00a0AWS hardware. Nvidia's failed attempt to purchase Arm for $40 billion in 2022 prompted the strategy shift.\u00a0 Haas argued that Arm was pivotal in defining technology in the mobile and computing industries but failed to bag the rightful dues.\u00a0 While companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom have licensed Arm's designs for their chips, Arm's designs are in nearly every cell phone due to their adherence to industry standards. Under Haas' leadership, Arm now offers complete blueprints for chips, charging higher royalty rates per device for more technologically advanced designs.\u00a0 This pivot aligns with a broader trend among tech giants, such as\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0AAPL),\u00a0Amazon.com,\u00a0Alphabet Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0GOOG) (NASDAQ:\u00a0GOOGL)\u00a0Google, and\u00a0Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0MSFT), who are developing custom chips for their products. The potential revenue in cloud computing, where Arm can charge more than a dollar per computing core, is expected to reach $28 billion by 2025, with a 95% gross margin for Arm.\u00a0 Haas envisions adjusting profitability based on industry conditions and aims to compete by providing higher value to customers.

                "body": "Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0will likely break new ground by making its\u00a0India-built iPhone 15\u00a0available on the global launch day, a significant shift in Apple\u2019s supply chain strategy as U.S.-China geopolitical tensions escalate. Traditionally, China manufactured the majority of iPhones. Still, with the introduction of the iPhone 15, Apple plans to offer India-assembled devices on the first day of sale, marking a milestone for Indian production, Bloomberg\u00a0cites\u00a0familiar sources.\u00a0 The production of the iPhone 15 commenced at a\u00a0Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd\u00a0(OTC:HNHPF)\u00a0Foxconn Technology Group\u00a0factory in southern Tamil Nadu in August, reflecting Apple\u2019s ongoing efforts to reduce the gap between its India operations and its primary manufacturing hubs in China. While this move signals Apple\u2019s confidence in India\u2019s production capabilities, there may be slight delays due to unforeseen logistics challenges.\u00a0 Apple\u2019s move aligns with the Indian Prime Minister\u2019s initiatives to boost local manufacturing and Apple\u2019s strategy to diversify its supply chain beyond China. The iPhone 15 will likely be a significant update, featuring enhancements to the camera system and an improved 3-nanometer processor for the Pro models.\u00a0 This launch is crucial for Apple as it seeks to rejuvenate sales following a decline over the past three quarters, partly due to subdued demand in key markets. There\u2019s a catch:\u00a0While the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are enjoying the \u2018Made in India\u2019 tag, the premium iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are still China-dependent. Apple\u2019s Indian suppliers now contribute to a\u00a0solid 7% of the global iPhone production. In addition to Foxconn, other\u00a0Apple suppliers in India, including\u00a0Pegatron Corp\u00a0and a\u00a0Wistron Corp\u00a0factory soon to be acquired by the\u00a0Tata Group, are also expected to assemble the iPhone 15. Apple\u2019s interest in the Indian market extends beyond manufacturing, opening its\u00a0first retail stores\u00a0this year.\u00a0 In the quarter through June, iPhone sales in India experienced double-digit growth, underlining the country\u2019s significance as both a retail opportunity and a production base for Apple. China\u2019s iPhone ban for government employees and\u00a0Huawei Technologies Co, Ltd\u2019s\u00a0smartphone launch sent jitters across the stock last week. However,\u00a0Morgan Stanley\u00a0does not see much downside to the moves as both Apple and China are crucial\u00a0to each other.

What Happened:\u00a0Apple has replaced its online store with a placeholder message: \u201cBe right back\u201d. This tactic has been a staple of Apple\u2019s strategy during major product launches. For now, visitors are directed to \u201cWatch the event\u201d with no other options available, temporarily suspending online purchases. While the closure does not guarantee the immediate availability of new products post-launch, the website is anticipated to be back up and running with details about\u00a0the iPhone 15, Apple Watch\u00a0Series 9, and other releases once the event concludes. See Also:\u00a0Deal Alert: Grab The 13-inch MacBook Air At Just $499 Upon reopening, the store might also feature new accessories like Watch bands. Customers may be allowed to customize their iPhone 15, but they will likely have to hold off on pre-orders until the date Apple specifies, traditionally the Friday after the launch. Why It Matters:\u00a0The upcoming \u201cWonderlust\u201d event on September 12 is expected to showcase a range of Apple\u2019s latest innovations, including the much-anticipated iPhone 15 series, updates to the Apple Watch and AirPods, and upcoming software updates. Despite the excitement, some observers, such as Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster, have expressed concerns that the event may not meet high expectations, particularly if there are no surprise new products or AI developments. Munster anticipates that the event will mainly feature enhancements to the iPhone, including camera improvements, a faster chip, better battery life, a lighter titanium casing, and a new programmable button, similar to the Apple Watch. Rumors suggest that pre-orders for the iPhone 15 will begin on September 15, with sales starting on September 22. However, those interested in the iPhone 15 Pro Max might have to wait a bit longer due to potential delays with camera components.

                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, META, NVDA, and AMZN. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY)\u00a0is trading close to our pivotal 447.94 mark. Bullish sentiments would favor a move above this, with a rally potentially reaching 449.42, solidifying it as a support. If momentum is sustained, we could see levels of 450.23, aiming for a peak of 451.01. Conversely, if 447.94 doesn't serve as a reliable foundation, a bearish trend might pull it down to 446.31. Intense selling could further depress it to 445.08, with a potential floor for the day at 443.90. The Q's (NASDAQ:QQQ) are trading close to 375.18. Bullish traders would prefer it to remain above this mark, with an eye on 375.98 as the next support. Dominance by the bulls would be signified by trading above 375.98, potentially soaring to 377.58, with an apex target of 378.93. However, if selling dominates, the 373.82 support might be tested. A failure to stay above this could lead to 372.91, and if the decline persists, 371.96, with the day potentially bottoming out at 370.91. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) position is a tad above 179.36. Bullish traders would want this level to serve as a bedrock, aiming for an ascent to 180.60. If the positive trend holds, 181.25 is in sight, with an apex target of 182.27. On the contrary, if 179.36 doesn't hold firm, a descent to 178.61 or even 178.18 is possible. Intense bearish activity might drag it to 177.31, with a potential floor at 176.84. Microsoft's\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) current position is just shy of 335.96. Bullish sentiments would favor a resurgence to this level, aiming to solidify it as support. If positive momentum is maintained, the next target is 337.80, potentially reaching 339.02, with an apex of 340.36. However, if 335.96 proves unreliable, a descent to 333.46 is on the cards. Further decline could touch 331.24, with the day potentially bottoming out at 328.52. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is currently positioned around 272.42. Those bullish on the stock are eyeing a stable base here, targeting a move towards 275.07. If the momentum remains positive, we could see levels reaching 278.11, with an ultimate goal of 281.32. However, if 272.42 proves unstable, a downward shift to 269.48 or possibly 266.83 is anticipated, with the day's lowest expected point at 264.46. Meta\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) is hovering around the 308.16 mark. Optimistic traders would like this to act as a strong support, setting sights on 309.51, with a peak target of 311.42. If, however, 308.16 fails to provide consistent support, a move down to 304.77 or potentially 301.71 is anticipated, with the day's lowest projection at 300.23. NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading near the 450.04 level. Those bullish on the stock are targeting this as a stable base, with aspirations to reach 454.09. If momentum remains on their side, 454.09 could be secured, with a peak target of 458.20. On the other hand, if 450.04 doesn't maintain its stability, a move down to 447.05 or potentially 442.76 is in view, with the day's lowest projection at 439.87. Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading around 142.38. Optimistic traders are hoping this acts as a solid support, with a potential move towards 143.51, and an ultimate goal of 144.58. Conversely, if 142.38 fails to act as a consistent support, a move down to 141.42 or even 140.52 is anticipated, with the day's lowest expected point at 139.37. Final Word: Today's trading dynamics will be influenced by data releases, with a particular emphasis on contract adjustments and traders gearing up for tomorrow's CPI announcement.

                "body": "In a surprising turn of events, a noted supply chain analyst has predicted that\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) may not release any new iPad models before the end of 2023, contrary to previous speculations. What Happened: Ming-Chi Kuo, a renowned analyst, tweeted on Monday that it\u2019s unlikely for Apple to release any new iPad models before the end of 2023. This announcement coincided with Apple\u2019s expected iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro reveal. \u4eca\u5e74\u5e74\u5e95\u524d\u4e0d\u5927\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u65b0\u6b3eiPad\u3002\u2014New iPad models are unlikely before the year's end. There had been widespread speculations about launching a new iPad Air 6 in October and unveiling new M3 Macs. However, this recent update from Kuo has put a damper on these expectations. See Also:\u00a0These 5 Big Changes In iPhone 15 Series Will Be The Stand-Out Upgrades Over iPhone 14 The unexpected development will disappoint iPad enthusiasts, even as anticipation builds for the iPhone 15 event. In addition to the new iPhones, Apple is also expected to introduce\u00a0the Apple Watch Series 9\u00a0and Apple Watch Ultra 2\u00a0during the event, which is to be live-streamed today. Why It Matters: This latest prediction by Kuo, if true, could significantly impact Apple\u2019s product roadmap, as well as the company\u2019s strategy for maintaining its dominance in the tablet market. Despite facing stiff competition from other tech giants, it\u2019s worth noting that Apple has always managed to stay ahead in the tablet market segment, largely due to its consistent innovation and regular product updates. The delay in the launch of new iPads could potentially allow competitors to gain ground. However, it remains to be seen how this will play out, especially given the anticipation surrounding the upcoming iPhone 15 and Apple Watch reveals. For now, Apple enthusiasts will have to wait and see what surprises the tech giant has in store.

                "title": "Apple 'Wonderlust' iPhone 15 Event Will Reveal Shift To Premium Products: Analyst",
                "body": "On the eve of Apple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) much-anticipated \"Wonderlust\" event, Rosenblatt Securities issued a note to investors giving its thoughts and expectations for the event, coupled with reflections on the Chinese government banning its employees from using Apple devices. Scheduled for Tuesday at 1 p.m. ET, Wonderlust will likely see Apple announce its iPhone 15 lineup, including the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, among other tech. The iPhone 15 and its Plus variant are predicted to share features from its predecessors \u2014 the iPhone 14 Pro series \u2014 notably the A16 Bionic Chip, Dynamic Island technology, and a 48MP camera. The new devices are expected to support USB-C charging, something that would unify Apple\u2019s charging ecosystem, as well as allow iPhone users to charge their devices with competing, and non-Apple chargers. Not to be overshadowed, the latest Apple Watches are expected to have a faster processor, marking an upgrade from previous models. Related:\u00a0These 5 Big Changes In iPhone 15 Series Will Be The Stand Out Upgrades Over iPhone 14 What do analysts think? Rosenblatt Securities shared its insights on the upcoming event and its implications, particularly concerning Apple's ties with China. The AAPL Analyst: Barton Crockett reiterated a Neutral rating on the Cupertino, California-based company and did not change his\u00a0$198 price target. Crockett said he expects the event will underscore Apple\u2019s strategic tilt towards premiumization, with the iPhone 15 series and an Apple Watch refresh. The company is transitioning towards promoting more premium models to boost its revenue per device. Coupled with market share gains, the shift could cushion Apple from the broader headwinds rocking the global smartphone industry, according to the analyst. The analyst noted that even though IDC reported a 7% decline in global smartphone sales for the second quarter of 2023, Apple remains resilient. Rosenblatt projects a potential 7% uptick in iPhone sales during the December quarter, attributing it to a blend of volume and ARPU expansion. On the geopolitical front, recent reports of China curbing iPhone usage among its government employees are stirring investor anxiety.\u00a0Rosenblatt said the concerns are not large enough to recalibrate its portfolio, highlighting President Joe Biden's recent deals that suggest a de-escalation around Taiwan. Given China's pivotal role in Apple's production and the country's\u00a0contribution to nearly a fifth of its sales, coupled with Apple's employment footprint in the region, Beijing's capacity for a rigid crackdown appears constrained, the analyst said. AAPL Price action: Shares of Apple were trading 1.2% lower\u00a0to $177.19 at the time of publication Tuesday, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

                "title": "'Magnificent Seven' Dominate S&P 500, But Haunting Echoes Of Dot-Com Bubble Resurface",
                "body": "A small group of stocks has seized the limelight on Wall Street, challenging the widely held belief that gains in the U.S. stock market are a dime a dozen.  Seven tech giants, to be precise, have surged by a jaw-dropping 100% or more year-to-date, leaving the rest of the crew in the dust. If you had the smarts to put together a portfolio with these seven big shots at the start of the year\u2014Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u2014your investment would now have doubled in size. Now, if you went the traditional route and stashed your cash in the broader SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), you\u2019d still be enjoying with a decent 17% return. But, you\u2019d still be way behind the tech giants\u2019 jaw-dropping gains. And for those who thought a rising market would lift everyone\u2019s boat, it\u2019s time for a reality check. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE:RSP) barely moved the needle with a modest 4% gain this year, failing to capture the explosive growth seen in the tech sector. Here\u2019s the real shocker: if you were to exclude these seven stock marvels from the S&P 500 index, you\u2019d be staring at negative returns for the remaining 493 companies in the index since the year began.  This underscores the overwhelming influence this elite group wields in shaping stock market fortunes this year. Chart: \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 vs. S&P 500, Equal-Weight S&P 500, and S&P 493 \u2013 YTD Performance as of Sept. 12, 2023 The meteoric rise of these tech titans is, in large part, attributed to the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI).  In the wake of a challenging 2022, these companies have harnessed the potential of AI to navigate turbulent waters, emerging not only unscathed but fortified for the journey ahead. Adding momentum to the tech fervor is the noteworthy decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which has descended to a mere 3.2% according to the latest July data.  This dip has buoyed expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon hit the brakes on its ongoing series of interest rate hikes, further fueling optimism within the tech sector. The unassailable reign of tech stocks has started to raise concerns about the sustainability of their gains, evoking memories of the dot-com bubble era. A glaring sign of this tech-centric surge is the Nasdaq 100\u2019s current valuation compared to that of small-cap stocks, a metric that has now exceeded the peak levels witnessed during the dot-com bubble. Data sourced from Market Chameleon paints a stark picture: the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) ETF stands at a staggering 35.02.  To put it simply, if we were to assume that the tech sector\u2019s earnings over the past 12 months remained constant indefinitely, it would take an investor a whopping 35 years to recoup their initial investment. This eye-popping number doesn\u2019t just edge past the three-year average of 30; it also overshadows the five-year average of 28. In simple terms, tech stocks are now 15% more costly than they have been over the last three years and a hefty 24% pricier compared to their typical valuation in the last five years.  This speaks volumes about how the market has already priced in exceptional growth when it comes to valuing tech stocks.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is seeing aggressive buying as bitcoin bulls believe the support has held. Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is \ud83d\udd12.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0 Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

                "body": "The cryptocurrency market soared in late 2021 with many coins hitting all-time highs. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) were among the cryptocurrencies that hit all-time highs in November 2021. One of the top company executives in the world shared a bullish take on cryptocurrency in 2021. Unfortunately, it coincided with the near peak of valuations, which could have been an inopportune moment for investors to place their bets. What Happened: Several companies added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in 2021, which was among the catalysts that helped propel the price forward. One company that was often rumored to get more friendly with cryptocurrency was Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed that he personally owned cryptocurrency, without specifying which cryptocurrencies he owned or how much. \u201cI do, yeah, I think it\u2019s reasonable to own it as part of a diversified portfolio,\u201d Cook told Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Conference when asked if he owned Bitcoin or Ethereum. \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in it for a while,\" he added. Cook said he had been researching cryptocurrency for a while, but shut down a notion that Apple would be adding crypto to its balance sheet. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go invest in crypto, not because I wouldn\u2019t in my own money, but because I don\u2019t think people buy Apple stock to get exposure to crypto.\u201d Aside from investing in crypto, Sorkin asked Cook about the possibility of accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for products like Apple Pay. \"It's something that we are looking at,\" he said, however, \"it's not something we have immediate plans to do.\" Related Link: 5 Things You Might Not Know About Apple CEO Tim Cook Investing $1,000 in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Apple Stock: Many cryptocurrency investors and fans of the sector buy based on specific events and catalysts. Hearing that the CEO of the biggest company in the world was bullish on cryptocurrency and owned Bitcoin or Ethereum was a catalyst that could send the price higher. Unfortunately, Cook\u2019s comments came almost to the day of the all-time high prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum. An investor could have bought 0.0149 Bitcoin with $1,000 on Nov. 9, 2021. The Bitcoin would be worth $390.52 today, down 60.9% from the original purchase price. An investor could have bought 0.2119 Ethereum with $1,000 on Nov. 9, 2021. The Ethereum would be worth $340.32 today, down 65.0% from the original purchase price. For comparison, an investor could have purchased 6.6979 shares of Apple stock with $1,000 at the same time. The investment in Apple stock would be worth $1,193.03 today. This represents a positive return of 19.3% over the last nearly two years. An investor who put the same $1,000 in the SPDR S&P 500 Global ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index, would have an investment worth $981.85 today, down 1.8% over the last nearly two years. Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021, one day after Cook\u2019s comments. Ethereum hit its all-time high of $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021, shortly after Cook\u2019s comments.

                "body": "Technology giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a major event called Wonderlust\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0to highlight the company\u2019s next product cycle. The company is expected to show off its new iPhone 15 and share details on the Apple Watch item line. Here\u2019s a look at some stocks of companies that are suppliers or competitors that could be volatile during and after the event. Sony Group Corp (NYSE:SONY): Apple is expected to highlight the photograph-taking capabilities of the iPhone 15 with Sony heavily involved. With Sony already a key supplier, news of the focus on the phone\u2019s camera could put the company heavier into the spotlight. Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM): Shares of Qualcomm jumped Monday after the company signed a deal with Apple to supply the Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF Systems for upcoming iPhones in 2024, 2025 and 2026. Related Link: Apple Wonderlust iPhone 15 Event Will Reveal Shift To Premium Products: Analyst\u00a0 Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ:SWKS): The Apple supplier is among the companies that help\u00a0with chips for the technology company. Some analysts have pointed to Skyworks being too reliant on revenue from Apple. As Apple develops more chips in-house, each Apple event that shows more chips made by Apple could spell bad news for Skyworks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM): The Taiwan-based company is a key supplier to Apple. The company could see its share price under pressure during and after the event. Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO): The company is a supplier for iPhones and Apple Watches, which could put Qorvo shares in the spotlight Tuesday. Broadcom Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO): Earlier this year, Apple and Broadcom announced a new multiyear, multibillion-dollar agreement. The deal will see Broadcom develop 5G RF components for Apple. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd\u00a0(OTC:SSNGY)(OTC:SSNLF): The Apple rival in the smartphone market could see its share price impacted by highlights from the event. Samsung is also a supplier to Apple and is expected to make displays for the new iPhone 15. Fossil Group Inc (NASDAQ:FOSL): The Wonderlust event will focus heavily on the iPhone, but many analysts expect the Apple Watch to give strong attention at the event as well. Fossil could see shares under pressure if new Apple Watch price points are well received and/or key features that set Fossil apart are included in new models.

                "body": "As tech enthusiasts and investors watch Apple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) much-anticipated Wonderlust event, there's more than just product launches to be excited about. Apple will announce its iPhone 15 lineup, including the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max\u00a0and more. But beyond the glamour of new product announcements, savvy investors are looking for sustainable ways to gain from their Apple holdings. One of the ways is through dividends. The Latest from Apple: The iPhone 15 and its Plus variant are expected to inherit some features from its predecessors, the iPhone 14 Pro series. The new devices are also rumored to support USB-C charging, which not only streamlines Apple's charging ecosystem but also offers iPhone users the flexibility to use non-Apple chargers. Read also:\u00a0Apple Wonderlust Event Puts iPhone 15 Suppliers, Competitors In The Spotlight: 8 Stocks To Watch The Dividend Perspective: While new product launches often lead to a spike in share prices \u2014 the stock is currently down but rising now \u2014 the long-term benefits of holding stocks come in the form of dividends for many investors. Let's get into how you can potentially earn $500 a month from Apple's dividends. By The Numbers: Given Apple Inc.'s current share price and its dividend yield of 0.54%, here's a breakdown of how investors can earn from dividends: To earn a monthly dividend payout of $500 (or $6,000 annually), an investor would need to own approximately 6,281 shares of Apple, which would run\u00a0$1,111,111. However, if you\u2019re aiming for a more modest monthly dividend of $100, an investment of $222,222 would work, which equates to around 1,256 shares. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. If the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Read Next:\u00a0How To Earn $500 A Month From RTX As Stock Tanks Over Recall Photo: Shutterstock",

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), on Tuesday, unveiled the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2, featuring speed and performance improvements. Apple's latest smartwatches were launched alongside the iPhone 15 series. What Happened: Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 were launched at the \u2018Wonderlust' event in Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park. While the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 feature iterative improvements over their predecessors, one of the highlights is a new S9 SiP (System in Package) for a faster, more seamless performance. This helps Apple perform Siri requests on-device instead of connecting to an Apple server. See Also: Here\u2019s Why Apple Took 8 Years To Bring USB-C To iPhone Despite Contributing To Its Development Apple has underlined its focus on sustainability, from the materials inside the new Apple Watches to the bands and packaging. While the company has increased the use of recycled cobalt and other materials, it also announced the phasing out of leather bands and the launch of a new range of bands called FineWoven. The Apple Watch Series 9 price starts at $399. It comes in two sizes \u2013 41mm and 45mm. It is available in aluminum and stainless steel options. Pre-orders start today, and in-store availability begins Sept. 22. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 price starts at $799. Apple Watch Series 9 Features: Powered by S9 SiP, the Apple Watch Series 9 will run watchOS 10 out of the box. Apple claims that the S9 SiP's GPU is 30% faster and has a four-core neural engine. One of the benefits of this is faster loading and boot times. It also enables Siri requests to be processed on-device, which also helps in improving power efficiency. Another notable improvement is the significantly brighter display \u2013 the Apple Watch Series 9 display can get as bright as 2,000 nits, which is double that of the Apple Watch Series 8. Apple has also introduced a new double-tap gesture that allows users to answer and end phone calls or snooze alarms. This can be triggered using the index finger and thumb. Apple Watch Ultra 2 Features: The Apple Watch Ultra 2 also sees some notable improvements over the original Ultra. Powered by the S9 SiP, it also supports Siri on-device like the Apple Watch Series 9. Its display brightness has increased to 3,000 nits from 2,000 nits on its predecessor. Rugged features have been a highlight of the Apple Watch Ultra series, and Apple has improved some of those with the Ultra 2. It also gets the same double-tap gesture that the Series 9 has for call and alarm management. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 can also operate up to 40 meters in the water. It also operates 500 meters below and 9,000 meters above the sea level. Apple Watch Ultra 2's battery is rated to last 36 hours on a single charge and up to 72 hours in low-power mode.

                "body": "In a landmark antitrust trial in Washington, the U.S. Justice Department slammed\u00a0Alphabet Inc's\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0Google\u00a0for\u00a0maintaining a monopoly\u00a0by allegedly paying over $10 billion annually to secure its position as the default search engine on web browsers and mobile devices.\u00a0 This move, the government argues, stifles competition and hampers innovation in the online search market,\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0reports. Also Read:\u00a0Google's Play Store Class Action Suit Nears Settlement for Antitrust Claims - Will Regulatory Overhang End? Kenneth Dintzer, a government lawyer, highlighted that Google achieved a monopoly by at least 2010 and currently holds over 89% of the online search market. The Justice Department and 52 attorneys general from states and U.S. territories allege that Google unlawfully maintained its monopoly by making substantial payments to tech rivals, smartphone manufacturers, and wireless providers. These payments were in exchange for Google being set as the preselected option or default on mobile phones and web browsers. The government argues that Google used default agreements to discourage rivals and wielded its market power to prevent\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) from pursuing alternatives better than Google as the default browser on its devices. Google's move left Apple with no choice but to concede to Google's demands. By 2020, Google reportedly paid Apple between $4 billion - $7 billion to maintain its default position on Safari. The government also contends that Google paid over $1 billion to wireless carriers to secure its status as the default on Android smartphones. The trial's first phase will determine whether Google illegally monopolized the online search market.\u00a0 If the Justice Department prevails, it may seek remedies in the second phase, potentially separating Alphabet's search business from other products, such as Android and Google Maps. Tech titans, including Google and\u00a0Amazon.Com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN), attracted global regulatory scrutiny for exploiting their influence over smaller players that could cost them the\u00a0breakup of their businesses.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) took the wraps off the iPhone 15 series featuring the highly anticipated USB-C port, periscope camera, and more at the \u2018Wonderlust' event in the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park. The iPhone 15 price starts at $799, with the top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max price starting at $1,199. See Also: Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2: Price, Features And Availability What Happened: Apple unveiled the iPhone 15 series at its \u2018Wonderlust' event. The latest flagship smartphones from Apple feature a series of upgrades, including the USB-C port, Dynamic Island across all four models, and the periscope camera on the top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apart from this, Apple also announced AirPods Pro and EarPods with a USB-C port, on expected lines. On expected lines, the iPhone 15 series starts at $799. The iPhone 15 price starts at $799 for the 128GB version. The iPhone 15 Plus price starts at $899 with 128GB storage. The iPhone 15 Pro price now starts at $999 with 128GB storage. The iPhone 15 Pro Max price now starts at $1,199 for the 256GB storage version. The iPhone 15 pre-orders start Sept. 15, and all four models will be available for purchase starting Sept. 22. The most talked about iPhone 15 feature is undoubtedly the USB-C port. After 11 long years, the Lightning port is now dead. Another notable upgrade is the 48MP primary camera, as compared to the iPhone 14's 12MP camera. Apart from this, Apple has also ditched the boat-shaped notch in favor of Dynamic Island on the non-Pro models as well. The mute switch is also dead now, replaced by the customizable Action button that has been borrowed from the Apple Watch Ultra. The A16 Bionic chipset powers the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max get a new A17 Pro silicon. Apple also uses Qualcomm Inc.'s (NASDAQ:QCOM) modem. Another highlight is the Tetraprism camera with 5x optical zoom on the top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max model, allowing for superior zoom capabilities.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled the highly anticipated iPhone 15 series at Apple Park, touting some crucial performance and design improvements over the iPhone 14 series. From the optics to the design and performance, there are quite a few things to unpack here. Like it happens with every new iPhone launch, the iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 debate could be confusing. To help you decide, we have explained all the key iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 changes that you need to keep in mind. What Happened: Apple launched the hotly anticipated iPhone 15 series with a range of design and performance improvements at the \u2018Wonderlust' event on Tuesday. There were a few surprises in store, as always. See Also: Apple iPhone 15 Series With USB-C, Tetraprism Camera Announced: Check Price And Availability Details The widely expected USB-C port is finally here. While Apple did not tout it as an \"innovative\" addition, it did underline the benefits of this universal port within its own ecosystem as well \u2013 the USB-C port is now available on MacBooks, iPads, iPhones, and even AirPods. Unsurprisingly, the standard iPhone 15 models support only USB 2.0 spec \u2013 this means users will be stuck with slower data transfer speeds. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max use USB 3.0, which supports up to 10Gbps data transfer speeds. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus received some crucial camera upgrades \u2013 the primary camera's resolution has been upped to 48MP from 12MP, and a 2x telephoto lens. Apple has also brought new automatic portrait features \u2013 if the subject is a person, a dog, or a cat, then the iPhone 15 captures depth information automatically. You also have the freedom to shift focus to a different subject if multiple subjects are in the frame after capturing the photo. The widely anticipated periscope camera is here on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, but Apple is calling it the Tetraprism camera instead. Another camera feature enthusiasts will appreciate is that the iPhone 15 Pro models support seven focal lengths, from macro to 120mm. Apple is also taking the first steps towards creating a content ecosystem for the Vision Pro headset \u2013 the iPhone 15 Pro models will get Spatial video support later this year. Apple has upgraded the design of the iPhone 15 Pro models to Grade 5 Titanium with a brushed look and contoured edges that make it more comfortable to hold the phone. The mute switch is now dead, replaced by the Action button. This button is customizable with nine different actions, as we reported earlier. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are powered by the brand-new A17 Pro chipset. Apple says that this is the \"biggest redesign in the history of Apple GPUs\". It supports hardware-based ray tracing, which Apple claims is four times faster than software-based solutions. All four iPhone 15 models now have Dynamic Island. Until the iPhone 14 series, this feature was restricted to the Pro models only, but Apple has expanded it to the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. If you want an iPhone without the dated notch, the iPhone 15 is what you need. Surprisingly, the much-talked-about iPhone 15 price hike did not materialize. Apple has kept the prices of all four iPhone 15 models virtually unchanged. The top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max now starts at $1,199 instead of $1,099, but the storage has been increased to 256GB instead of 128GB.

What happened:\u00a0Apple has listed a new USB-C to Lightning Adapter for $29 on its online store. It comes right after the new iPhones switched to USB Type-C ports for charging and data transfers. See Also: Here\u2019s Why Apple Took 8 Years To Bring USB-C To iPhone Despite Contributing To Its Development The design team at Apple, who had championed the Lightning port as not just functionality but an emblem of brand identity, were faced with an EU directive pushing for uniformity. The decision is official \u2014 the iPhone 15 series now sports the USB Type-C port. Yet, Apple, known for its ingenious business strategies, recognized an opportunity. A massive user base is already entrenched in the Lightning ecosystem. What would become of their existing chargers, headphones, and other accessories? Thus, with a strategic move that straddles the line between customer support and revenue generation, Apple introduced the Lightening to USB Type-C connector. Interestingly, this debut was absent from the grandeur of their launch presentation. Image \u2013 Apple Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

What To Know: Tuesday's report follows an already rough week for Apple stock, particularly in relation to China and Huawei. Recently, China announced a ban on the use of Apple devices for official use, the first comprehensive attempt by the country to reduce its reliance on foreign technology. The move coincided with Huawei's newly introduced Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro smartphones which can potentially offer a Chinese-made high-end competitor to the iPhone. A report impying an increase in Huawei's shipment target by 20% of the Mate 60 series smartphone sank Apple stock further Tuesday. Apple\u00a0is also in the spotlight\u00a0following the company's Wonderlust\u00a0event today.

                "body": "In the wake of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s much-hyped  Apple\u2019s Wonderlust Event 2023, Wall Street was bracing for a spectacular surge in the tech giant\u2019s stock.  Reality proved to be quite the opposite.  What was supposed to be a fireworks display of innovation turned into a damp squib, and AAPL shares are feeling the heat. Benzinga will unravel how Apple\u2019s stock reacted to the event, and what the key levels are to watch ahead for the stock price.  The response from investors was underwhelming, as Apple\u2019s shares experienced a 1.71% decline to $176.30 Tuesday.  Intriguingly, when examining the 5-minute intraday chart, it becomes evident the stock\u2019s decline intensified during the Apple Wonderlust Event. This suggests that the market didn\u2019t initially warm up to Apple\u2019s new product offerings. The share price found support at $174.8, the day\u2019s low, which coincided with the moment Apple revealed the pricing for the new iPhone 15 Pro. Despite a brief rebound to $176.75, the shares once again encountered selling pressure, ultimately pulling back to the daily lows as of the time of writing.  An intraday volume analysis identified $176.92 as the level with the highest daily trading volume on AAPL shares. Interestingly, this level corresponds to the price at which Apple\u2019s shares were trading at the start of the Apple Wonderlust Event, indicating it could serve as a significant resistance mark moving forward. Read Also: Apple iPhone 15 Series With USB-C, Tetraprism Camera Announced: Check Price And Availability Details Shifting from the intraday chart to the daily chart, we observe that Apple\u2019s stock prices have struggled to breach the 21-day moving average resistance, situated around $180. This resistance level has proven a big hurdle, as it was tested but never broken over the last three market sessions. As a result, the short-term trend remains bearish, with the 21-day moving average trading below the 50-day moving average. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is also signaling a worrying move downward. Looking to the downside, the $170 support holds significant importance as it served as a solid floor for Apple\u2019s stock back in May. Furthermore, it aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level between the 2023 price highs and lows. September has so far proven to be a challenging month for Apple, with prices experiencing a 6% decline. This decline extends the losses observed after a 4.4% negative close in August.

Why It's Important: Titanium is known for being an extremely durable metal, but it also has one of the best strength-to-weight ratios. This allowed Apple to not only reduce the weight of the new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max but also improve the overall strength and durability. As a result, the iPhone 15 Pro Max now weighs just 7.8 ounces compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max's 8.47 ounces. On the other hand, the iPhone 15 Pro weighs 6.6 ounces, down from the iPhone 14 Pro's 7.27 ounces. \"You'll notice the difference the moment you pick one up,\" Apple says.

The most notable difference lies in the color options available.\u00a0 While the Series 8 came in Midnight, Starlight, Silver, and Product Red, the Series 9 offers additional choices.\u00a0 The aluminum models of the Series 9 come in pink, starlight, silver, midnight, and product red. For those opting for stainless steel, it\u2019s available in gold, silver, and graphite. On a more environmentally friendly note, Apple has also introduced\u00a0FineWoven, a microtwill fabric made from 68% recycled materials. From now on, the tech giant won\u2019t use leather in any new Apple products, including watch bands. See Also:\u00a0Analyst Bets On Apple Watch\u2019s X Redesign: \u2018Will Add Material Value\u2019 Performance: Brighter Display And 30% Faster GPU One of the most significant changes lies under the hood with introducing the S9 System in Package or SiP. With 5.6 billion transistors, a GPU that\u2019s 30% faster, and a four-core neural engine, the Series 9 boasts substantial performance improvements. The Watch Series 9 is also equipped with a new 4-core Neural Engine that demonstrates the capability to process machine learning tasks at double the speed of its predecessor.\u00a0 Additionally, a second-generation ultra-wideband chip enhances precision in location tracking. For the unversed, Precision Finding does more than just tell users where their lost iPhone is. It gives clear directions and even guides them with pictures, vibrations, and sounds.\u00a0 The Series 9 also flaunts a brighter display, reaching up to 2000 nits, doubling the maximum brightness of the Series 8. Features: Checkout The New \u201cDouble-Tap\u201d Action When it comes to features, Apple often introduces innovations with each new iteration of its smartwatch. The Series 8 introduced\u00a0a skin temperature sensor, aiding in cycle tracking and crash detection. Meanwhile, the\u00a0Series 7 showcased a QWERTY keyboard. The Series 9, however, brings some exciting additions to the table. A standout feature is the \u201cdouble-tap\u201d function, allowing users to perform actions like answering phone calls by tapping their index finger and thumb together.\u00a0 Additionally, Siri requests are now processed on the device, enhancing responsiveness. \u201cFor requests that do not require information from the internet, such as starting a workout or setting a timer, Siri does not rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses.\u201d Battery Life: A Familiar Story In the realm of battery life, the Series 8 was rated for 18 hours of usage under typical conditions, including fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and an always-on display. However, the Apple Watch\u2019s low power mode extended this lifespan to up to 36 hours. While some users had hoped for a substantial battery life improvement in the Series 9, Apple has not delivered a significant boost.\u00a0 The Series 9\u2019s battery life remains in line with its predecessor, falling short of the impressive endurance in\u00a0Fitbit\u00a0or\u00a0Garmin\u00a0watches.\u00a0 Price: No Surprises Apple has maintained a consistent pricing strategy for its smartwatches, and the Series 9 is no exception. The starting price for the Apple Watch Series 8 mirrored that of the Series 7 and most preceding models, commencing at $399 for the 41mm variant.\u00a0 Unsurprisingly, the Series 9 also begins at $399, aligning with its predecessor\u2019s pricing structure.\u00a0 Interested users can now start ordering the device, which will be available in the U.S. beginning Sept. 22.\u00a0 Image Courtesy: Apple Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), on Tuesday, announced a feature on its new iPhone 15 lineup targeting car owners and driving enthusiasts at its \u201cWonderlust\u201d event.  What Happened: Roadside assistance via satellite builds on Apple\u2019s existing satellite infrastructure used for emergency SOS. It helps connect users to a roadside assistance provider if their car runs into trouble even while they are off the grid and a call can\u2019t go through.  In the U.S., the feature is being launched with AAA Roadside assistance.  How To Use: To avail of the service, a user simply has to text roadside assistance and the iPhone screen will show a series of common troubles that the driver may need help with. This includes getting locked out, running out of fuel or charge, a flat tire or even that the vehicle doesn\u2019t start. The iPhone user can also detail any other trouble they might be facing.  The interface will then guide the user to connect to a satellite. The information will be shared with a roadside assistance provider who will then dispatch help to your location with the right tools and equipment.  Why It Matters: Apple already has an emergency SOS via satellite feature for serious emergencies that require a first responder.  The Emergency SOS via satellite feature allows users to message emergency services even when cellular and WiFi coverage is not available.\u00a0 The Emergency Satellite SOS feature is available across 14 countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.. It will also expand to Spain and Switzerland this month.  Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.

The latest lineup promises significant enhancements in both performance and design compared to the previous iPhone 14 series. What Happened: iPhone enthusiasts may recall that in 2011, when the iPhone 4s was released, its price tag amounted to a staggering 162 BTC, data from CoinGecko reveals. At that time, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was still in its early stages and not as widely recognized as it is today. As the years went by, the price of iPhones in Bitcoin witnessed significant variations. The iPhone 5 was valued at around 53 BTC, followed by the iPhone 5s at approximately 5 BTC. With the release of the iPhone 6, the price dropped to 1.7 BTC. The subsequent release of the iPhone 6s saw a slight increase to 2.8 BTC. Are you buying the new iPhone 15?

The iPhone XS was valued at around 0.15 BTC, while the iPhone 11 saw a decrease to 0.068 BTC. In 2020, the introduction of the iPhone 12 saw another decline to 0.051 BTC. Looking ahead to the future, it\u2019s interesting to note that Bitcoin\u2019s increasing adoption and market maturity influenced the prices of the more recent iPhone models. The iPhone 13 was priced at approximately 0.018 BTC, while the projected price of the upcoming iPhone 14 stands at around 0.042 BTC and iPhone 15 at 0.031 BTC, which goes to $799. At current price, 0.0031 BTC is equivalent to 3099882.541 satoshis.Satoshis are the smallest unit of bitcoin, representing a fraction of one bitcoin. One Satoshi is equivalent to 0.00000001 BTC.

                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is finally heeding to all the iPhone battery complaints with a new feature in the just-launched iPhone 15 series. What Happened: Apple will add an option in the iPhone 15 to limit the maximum battery charge to help conserve battery capacity over the phone\u2019s life, according to code snippets found by 9to5mac. See Also: Apple iPhone 15 Series With USB-C, Tetraprism Camera Announced: Check Price And Availability Details The new option will include a hard stop for battery charging \u2013 beyond this point, the phone will simply not charge even if it is plugged in or placed on a wireless charger. This will help extend the battery\u2019s life and prevent degradation since lithium-ion batteries age faster when charged to full capacity. One of the workarounds to this limitation has been the \u2018Optimized Battery Charging' feature that Apple introduced a few years ago. This feature learns your usage patterns and charges at a normal pace till 80% and then uses trickle charging technology to finish the full 100% charge when you are likely to use the phone again. Why It Matters: While useful, the optimized charging feature seems to have been inadequate. Numerous people have reported that their iPhone 14 battery capacity has fallen below the 90% level in less than a year of usage. Moreover, Apple policies suggest that the company won't service most of the iPhone 14 battery complaints under warranty. In such a scenario, the hard stop at a certain battery charge level will ensure that the phone simply stops charging beyond that point, so the degradation should be slower. A similar option exists on several Android smartphones, including Samsung Galaxy phones. Image \u2013 Apple Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

What Happened:\u00a0During the event streamed from Cupertino, California, CEO\u00a0Tim Cook\u00a0briefly introduced the proceedings, highlighting recent Mac and Vision Pro headset launches. COO\u00a0Jeff Williams\u00a0then took over, focusing on the new Apple Watches.

They\u2019re giving him air time to build his personal brand. It\u2019s reassuring to see a clear succession plan in motion.\u201d It just hit me.

He is also responsible for the company\u2019s health initiatives. Williams, according to the company, played a key role in Apple's entry into the mobile phone market with the launch of the iPhone, and since 2010 has led worldwide operations for all products. He led the engineering development of the Apple Watch. He joined Apple in 1998 as head of Worldwide Procurement. Cook succeeded\u00a0Steve Jobs\u00a0as CEO in 2011, and speculation\u00a0about his potential departure\u00a0arose in late 2022, following the launch of a new product category. Candidates suggested to succeed the 63-year-old Cook included Williams, Senior Vice President\u00a0Greg Joswiak, retail chief\u00a0Deirdre O\u2019Brien, and hardware engineering lead\u00a0John Ternus.

                "title": "China iPhone Ban Escalation: Xi Jinping Government Says It Has Noticed 'Security Incidents' With Apple's iPhones",
                "body": "The China iPhone ban seems to be escalating further, with the Xi Jinping administration stating that it has noticed \"security incidents\" with Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones. What Happened: Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning issued a statement underlining that there have been \"some security incidents\" involving Apple's iPhones, reported Bloomberg. See Also: Apple iPhone 15 Series With USB-C, Tetraprism Camera Announced: Check Price And Availability Details \"We notice that there have been some security incidents concerning Apple phones,\" said Ning during a regular press briefing. Ning did not elaborate exactly what these \"security incidents\" are that she refers to, so it is an open-ended statement. The statement coincides with the launch of the iPhone 15 series and could potentially sway public opinion in a key Apple market. China alone accounts for 19% of Apple's revenue, so any adverse shift in public opinion could have a material impact on the company's topline. This comes days after multiple reports of China banning iPhones and other foreign-made devices. While initial reports suggested that the ban was being enforced only on China's central government employees, another report suggested that the ban has been expanded to state-run agencies and other government-controlled organizations as well. No Ban On iPhones: However, Ning seemed to quell these reports, stating that there is no such iPhone ban in place. \"China has not issued laws and regulations to ban the purchase of Apple or foreign brands' phones,\" she said. This seems to run contrary to the resurgence of Chinese tech giant Huawei, coinciding with the alleged iPhone ban. Huawei launched the Mate 60 series smartphone with a new 7-nanometer chipset. After witnessing a surge in demand, Huawei reportedly increased its shipment target by 20%. It remains to be seen if the China iPhone ban is informal now that the foreign ministry spokeswoman has denied that there is an official ban in place.

As a part of this deal, Apple is currently offering a trade-in discount of up to $650 on existing iPhones \u2013 the iPhone 14 Pro Max fetches the maximum discount of $650. Interestingly enough, Samsung's most expensive smartphone right now, the Galaxy Z Fold 5, fetches a discount of just $460 at most, despite costing up to $2,160 for the top-tier 1TB version. This is almost the same discount Apple is offering on the iPhone 12 Pro Max.

                "title": "Apple iPhone 15 Pro Innovation? Nope, Android's Done It Before: From Action Button To USB-C To 3D Video Recording",
                "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched the much-hyped iPhone 15 series with some design and hardware upgrades across models. While some improvements are fresh and tempting, it so happens that many of these features were already present on Android phones, some of them dating back to 12 years ago. What Happened: Apple's iPhone 15 series not only borrows from the Apple Watch Ultra but also several Android smartphones. Many of these features are highlights of the iPhone 15, and they happen to have been present on Android phones several years ago. See Also: You Can Get The iPhone 15 Pro For As Low As $349 \u2013 Here\u2019s How Some of these core features that Apple announced during Tuesday's \u2018Wonderlust' launch event include the USB-C port, Action button, Spatial Video, and more. Apple has brought them together in one package, but Android phone makers might consider these features to be \"inspired\", to put it mildly. 1. USB-C The clincher is, of course, the USB-C port. Apple dragged the Lightning port for the longest time \u2013 11 years \u2013 even though it might have had its own reasons to do so. The iPhone 15 now has a USB-C port, thanks to EU regulations. But Apple is neither the first to do it nor is the feature innovative or new. The first smartphone with a USB-C port was the LeEco Le Max, launched back in 2015. Although the company has shut down, the USB-C port itself is now ubiquitous in the Android world, with almost every major smartphone featuring this port in the last few years. 2. Action Button Apple borrowed a couple of Apple Watch Ultra features for the iPhone 15, but Android phones did it first. In fact, the customizable button that replaced the mute switch has been present on numerous Android phones for several years now. From HTC to Motorola and industry leader Samsung, many companies have included a customizable button in some way. 3. Periscope Camera One of the highlights of the top-tier iPhone 15 Pro Max is its periscope camera, which Apple has branded \"Tetraprism\". That said, Android phones have had periscope cameras for several years now. While the Sharp 902 launched in 2004 was technically the first phone with a periscope lens, the Huawei P30 Pro launched in 2019 offered up to 5x optical zoom, the same as the iPhone 15 Pro Max. However, to be fair to Apple, the iPhone 15 Pro Max implementation is quite innovative and saves space. Apple has a three-fold periscope design that saves space and lets in more light, so it should help deliver better results. 4. Spatial Video The Apple Vision Pro headsets need 3D content, and what better way to do it than to implement these capabilities on the iPhone 15 Pro? It also shows Apple is serious about virtual reality. But Android phones did it 12 years ago. The first Android phone with 3D video recording support was the HTC Evo 3D, launched back in 2011. It felt gimmicky back then, especially with phones not being as powerful, but the A17 Pro-powered iPhone 15 Pro could just be what the 3D video feature needs to gain momentum. Apple's track record with pushing existing features into the mainstream is good, but this could fall by the wayside. 5. Titanium Frame One of the highlights of the iPhone 15 Pro is the titanium frame. It's the same alloy that NASA used on the Mars rover Perseverance, so we know the iPhone 15 Pro's chassis could survive a space flight. While this design has been borrowed from the Apple Watch Ultra, the Essential Phone did it first in 2017.

                "title": "Key Apple Supplier TSMC Eyes Japan Amidst US Hurdles in Chip Production",
                "body": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd\u00a0(NYSE:TSM), the leading contract chipmaker, faces recruitment and production challenges in\u00a0its Arizona factory.\u00a0 In contrast, it's growing confident in Japan, where a fab in Kyushu will likely produce chips in 2024. TSMC is considering adding capacity and another fab in Japan for advanced chips.\u00a0 Successful expansion in Japan could boost the country's chip manufacturing efforts amid regional competition, Reuters reports. The key\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0AAPL) and\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA) supplier's $40 billion factory will likely be operational by 2024. A second facility nearby will probably make 3-nm chips - to be up and running by 2026. TSMC's overseas expansion depends on customer needs, government support, and cost considerations.\u00a0 In Arizona, the chipmaker faces worker shortages and union opposition in migrating workers from Taiwan, delaying production to 2025. Despite challenges, TSMC views Japan favorably due to cultural alignment and government support. Japan offers a network of chip equipment suppliers, a similar work culture, and proximity to Taiwan.\u00a0 Japanese workers' willingness to work long hours aligns with TSMC's need for continuous chip production. TSMC's partnership with Japanese companies, including Sony, further supports its Japanese expansion. While TSMC welcomes Taiwanese workers, it aims to secure local employees by offering higher wages.\u00a0 The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) has provided subsidies for TSMC's first fab project and is open to a second fab. Despite enthusiasm for Japan, TSMC is cautious about rising costs and the macro environment.\u00a0 Capital spending has surged in recent years, and the chipmaker faces higher-than-expected charges in the U.S. and concerns about the work culture in Germany, where it plans to build a fab.\u00a0 However, TSMC's leading technology gives it pricing power despite cost challenges. Meanwhile, the U.S. and China\u00a0geopolitical tensions continue\u00a0to escalate as the U.S. imposed semiconductor technology sanctions on the Asian country, restricting its progress.\u00a0 China has, in recent years, boosted its military presence near democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as its own. Taiwan strongly rejects\u00a0China's sovereignty claims. Price Action:\u00a0TSM shares traded lower by 0.41% at $90.11 premarket on the last check Wednesday.

                "body": "In an innovative turn,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) has launched\u00a0the iPhone 15 Pro series,\u00a0introducing the Action button, a not-so-unique but useful replacement for the traditional Silent Mode button. This hardware addition is expected to transform the user experience. What Happened: The new Action button\u00a0on the iPhone 15 Pro provides enhanced functionalities surpassing the old Silent Mode button, thanks to Apple\u2019s ProMotion technology. See Also:\u00a0The 14-inch MacBook Pro With M1 Max Is Available At A Huge $1,800 Discount The Action Button can activate the camera, flashlight, Voice Memo, open a note, switch Focus modes, or run custom shortcuts. Additionally, it supports accessibility options like Magnifier. By default, the Action Button toggles the iPhone between ring and vibrate. This is essential as it takes over the ring/vibrate switch function present since the iPhone\u2019s introduction in 2007. When toggling modes, users will experience haptic feedback. The Pro\u2019s button retains the same position for those accustomed to silencing their iPhones by feeling for the switch in their pockets. The Action button\u2019s features are displayed on Dynamic Island, allowing users to interact without physically touching their\u00a0iPhone 15 Pro and Pro\u00a0Max screens. This offers easy access to numerous functions and applications. Why It Matters: Apple\u2019s introduction of the Action button signifies a strategic move towards creating a smoother, more interactive iPhone experience. This is particularly beneficial for users with specific challenges. Apple\u2019s commitment to pushing the limits of mobile device technology is evident in this innovative development.

According to a viral TikTok video spotted by Daily Mail, Tanna Barker narrated the incident, explaining how she swallowed the device while chatting with a friend. Barker had taken out her AirPod to hear better and accidentally popped it into her mouth, thinking it was a vitamin.

She continued her story, \u201cSo I guzzled my water, kept on going, said bye to [the friend] and went to go get my AirPod. And my pills were in my hand. I swallowed my AirPod.\u201d After realizing her mistake, Barker immediately reached out to friends and doctors. The unanimous advice she received was to let the device pass naturally. This odd incident is not an isolated one. In February 2021, a man from Massachusetts swallowed one of his AirPods in his sleep, which had to be removed via emergency endoscopy. In November of the same year, another Massachusetts woman swallowed her AirPod after mistaking it for an ibuprofen. In June 2022, a UK celebrity also swallowed an AirPod, mistaking it for a vitamin.

                "title": "Market Clubhouse Morning Memo - September 13th, 2023 (Trade Strategy For SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, AMZN, TSLA, And NVDA)",
                "body": "Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, META, AMZN, TSLA, and NVDA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPY\u00a0(NYSE:SPY) is trading near the 445.08 marker. For bullish enthusiasts, maintaining above this level is crucial. A positive momentum might propel it past 446.31, establishing it as a new support. If the upward trend persists, we could witness it reaching 447.94, with an optimistic end-of-day target at 449.42. However, if 445.08 fails to provide stability, bearish tendencies might pull it towards 443.90, and if the downward pressure intensifies, it could touch 443.42. In the event of a significant sell-off, the day might conclude around 442.04. The Q's\u00a0(NASDAQ:QQQ) are hovering around 371.96. For those bullish, sustaining above this level is the goal, with aspirations to reach 372.91. Dominance by the bulls would be indicated by levels surpassing 373.82, potentially reaching 375.18, with an optimistic peak at 375.98. Yet, if the selling pressure mounts and 371.96 doesn't stand its ground, a downward trajectory towards 370.91 is anticipated. Further decline might touch 370.08, with the day's potential lowest point at 369.39. Apple's\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) current stance is near 175.81. Bullish traders would want this level to act as a stronghold, aiming for an upward move to 176.29. If the momentum is favorable, it could climb to 176.84, with an end-of-day high target of 177.31. Conversely, if 175.81 is breached, a move towards 175.09 is possible. Intense selling might drag it to 174.05, with the day potentially concluding around 173.24. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading in the vicinity of 331.24. For the bulls, the goal is to surpass this level, solidifying it as a support. If the upward trend is sustained, the next milestone is 333.46, potentially reaching 335.96, with an optimistic peak at 337.80. On the flip side, if 331.24 doesn't offer stability, a move towards 328.52 is on the horizon. Further decline could touch 326.05, with the day's potential lowest point at 324.81. Meta's\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) current mark is 301.71. Bullish perspectives hope for this to act as a foundation, eyeing a rise to 304.77, with aspirations for a peak at 308.16 by day's end. Should 301.71 not hold, a decline to 300.23 is expected. Strong bearish forces could drive it further to 297.33, with a possible day's close at 295.97. Amazon's\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) current stance is around 140.52. Those with a positive outlook aim to solidify above this point, with sights set on 141.42 and a hopeful peak of 142.38 by day's end. If 140.52 doesn't stand firm, a decline to 139.37 is likely. Strong downward pressures could see it touching 138.76, with a potential finish at 138.03. Tesla's\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) current position hovers at 272.42. Those optimistic on the stock aim to push beyond this, setting sights on 275.07. With sustained upward drive, levels of 278.11 are in view, with a hopeful peak at 281.32. If 272.42 doesn't offer stability, a slide to 269.48 is in view. Strong bearish forces might drive it further to 266.83, with a potential finish at 264.46. NVIDIA's\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) current level is near 450.04. Bullish traders hope to exceed this, establishing it as a new base. With positive drive, it might reach 454.09, with aspirations for a peak at 458.20. However, if 450.04 doesn't provide a solid base, a slide to 447.05 is likely. Strong downward pressures could see it touching 442.76, with a potential close at 439.87.

Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is indeterminable due to heavy noise in the data and upcoming quadruple witching.\u00a0This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

KeyBanc Capital Markets\u00a0analyst John Vinh had\u00a0an Overweight rating and a price target of $200. Needham analyst Laura Martin had\u00a0a Buy rating and a price target of $195. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi had\u00a0a Market Perform rating and a price target of $195. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives had\u00a0an Outperform rating and raises the price target from $230 to $240. Bank of America on Apple: The Wonderlust event from Apple and the iPhone unveiling went mostly as expected, according to Mohan. \u201cThese launches are typically \u2018sell on the news\u2019 events, and today was no different,\u201d Mohan said. The analyst said the pricing was a key item from the event. \u201cThe unchanged pricing for the iPhone 15/Plus/Pro and the higher starting price for the ProMax is a reflection of a challenged consumer spending environment offset by confidence in the price in-elasticity of the high-end consumer.\u201d Related Link: iPhone 15 Vs. iPhone 14: The Seven Biggest Changes And One Surprise\u00a0 Goldman Sachs on Apple: The pricing for the iPhone 15 models could lead to a benefit for average sale prices for Apple, according to Ng. \u201cU.S. carrier launch promotions for the iPhone 15 should support demand with instant and bill credits potentially covering the purchase price of the phone,\u201d Ng said. The analyst added that games such as\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage\u00a0launching natively on mobile and roadside assistance were key features highlighted at the event. Morgan Stanley on Apple: Shares of Apple continue to have overhang after news that China could be banning iPhone use by government staff. The event left little to crush this overhang for Woodring, but the analyst is bullish on the fiscal year 2024 outlook. \u201cChina will remain a near-term overhang, but we still believe there is upside to FY24 expectations,\u201d Woodring said. The analyst said the event was largely in-line with expectations with few surprises, which wasn\u2019t enough to offset continued investor focus on China. \u201cTaking a step back, we don\u2019t believe today\u2019s event will sway the growing cohort of bears that see China as a re-emerging, paramount risk not embedded in today\u2019s $175 stock price.\u201d KeyBanc Capital markets\u00a0on Apple: The Wonderlust event and iPhone 15 unveil could have positive implications for Apple suppliers, according to Vinh. \u201cWe see moderately positive implications for the Apple supply chain given content increases for AVGO, QRVO, SWKS, CRUS and neutral implications for QCOM given no changes to mmW bands or regions,\u201d Vinh said. \u201cWe see the addition of two incremental 5G bands as moderately positive for the RF group (AVGO, QRVO, SWKS), while the upgrade to WiFi 6E for Pro/Max is moderately positive for AVGO and SWKS.\u201d For Apple, Vinh saw\u00a0the Wonderlust event as \u201ca modest negative\u201d for the company with a lack of price increases for several models and a lack of reasons for consumers to upgrade. Along with the rating on Apple, Vinh has the following ratings and price targets on Apple suppliers: Broadcom In (NASDAQ:AVGO): Overweight, $1,000 price target Cirrus Logic, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRUS): Overweight, $110 price target Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ: QRVO): Sector Weight, $95 price target Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM): Overweight, $145 price target Skyworks Solutions Ind\u00a0(NASDAQ:SWKS): Overweight, $130 price target Needham on Apple: The Wonderlust event was well received by Martin who said \u201cbrand trumps products.\u201d \u201cA brand only has economic value if it commands a higher price point, lowers customer acquisition costs, and/or lowers churn which drives higher lifetime value. Apple\u2019s iPhone event yesterday achieved all 3,\u201d Martin said. Bernstein on Apple: The new double tap feature of the Apple Watch was a key highlight from Apple\u2019s event for Sacconaghi. Apple retaining prices was also another key highlight for the analyst. \u201cContrary to expectations, Apple essentially retained prices on all iPhones (and watches) in the U.S.; international pricing has changed modestly, reflecting currency movements,\u201d Sacconaghi said. The key question for Sacconaghi is if there will be a strong cycle for the iPhone 15, with the company\u2019s biggest cycles led by \u201cform factor changes.\u201d \u201cGiven the cadence of strong cycles every three years, one might anticipate that the FY 24 cycle might also be strong. That said, a key question will be whether the collective offering \u2014\u00a0particularly the camera \u2014\u00a0will be compelling enough to implore users to upgrade.\u201d The analyst is cautious on expectations for a strong iPhone cycle in fiscal year 2024. Wedbush on Apple: The iPhone 15 launch upgrade cycle could surprise to the upside, said Ives who issued early reactions after the event and another updated note Wednesday with the price target increase. \u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 15 launch event was overall an impressive event which in our opinion lays the groundwork for a major upgrade cycle over the next year that will surprise the Street to the upside,\u201d Ives said. AAPL Price Action: Apple shares are down 0.37% to $175.65\u00a0on Wednesday versus a 52-week price range of $124.17 to $198.23. Apple shares are up over 40% year-to-date in 2023.

However, Apple has opted to raise prices for specific models in key markets like China, Japan, and India. Also Read:\u00a0Huawei's Re-emergence Is Not A Threat To Apple's Strong Ecosystem In China, which represents nearly 20% of Apple's total sales, prices for most iPhone 15 models have increased, particularly for higher storage options.\u00a0 For example, the 512GB iPhone 15 now costs 300 Chinese yuan more than the iPhone 14.\u00a0 In India, Apple has kept the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus prices stable but increased the prices for all iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models, CNBC\u00a0reports. The price hikes in China and India are partly due to the depreciation of their respective currencies against the U.S. dollar over the past year.\u00a0 The Pro models are more likely to be imported than locally manufactured in India, incurring higher import taxes.\u00a0 However, these price increases primarily affect the more expensive models and may not significantly impact consumer sentiment among premium smartphone buyers. Apple's pricing strategy for the\u00a0iPhone\u00a015 appears cautious, with modest price increases.\u00a0 This approach comes as Apple aims to maintain revenue growth amid challenges in the smartphone market. While global smartphone shipments will likely decline, higher prices targeting the wealthier consumer segment may help support Apple's revenue.\u00a0 The company has also introduced price cuts in specific markets, like the U.K., where the iPhone 15 is \u00a350 cheaper than its predecessor, the iPhone 14. Meanwhile, Apple faced a lackluster response to its annual iPhone release in China, highlighting growing challenges in one of its key markets. The event attracted millions of views on Weibo, a central Chinese social media platform. Still, it failed to become a trending topic among Weibo's vast user base, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reports.

                "body": "Wall Street edged higher during Wednesday\u2019s midday session, despite the August CPI report showing the annual inflation rate rising to 3.7%, above the predicted 3.6%. The unexpected uptick, also coupled with a monthly core inflation exceeding expectations (0.3% vs. 0.2%), did not lead to significant disruptions in the interest rate landscape. The increase, primarily driven by a rise in energy prices, was perceived by the market as something the Fed is likely to look through. Consequently, expectations have remained unchanged, with traders now almost certainly pricing in a hold on rates at the FOMC meeting next week, while uncertainties linger regarding the November decision.  On a weaker note, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continued to trade in the red. Investors are exercising caution amidst concerns of a potential iPhone ban in China, compounded by a lackluster reception for Apple\u2019s Tuesday iPhone launch event.

                "body": "The UK-based chip design firm, Arm Holdings, is gearing up for a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) that could value the company at a staggering $54 billion. The IPO is slated to be the most significant in the tech sector in two years. What To Know:  Arm and its parent company, SoftBank (OTC:SFTBF), are in the final stages of pricing their shares for the IPO. Trading is expected to commence on Thursday on the Nasdaq exchange. The share price is likely to exceed initial estimates due to overwhelming demand, Financial Times reports. The IPO has garnered immense interest, with the stock being more than five times oversubscribed. This has led to the anticipation that the share price could be set above the initial range of $47 to $51. The IPO is expected to raise approximately $5 billion for SoftBank, which is offering 9.4% of Arm's stock. SoftBank initially hoped Arm would be at as much as $70 billion, however that was dampened by investor concern due to a recent decline in profits. Tensions with China on the technology front and growing demand for AI are other factors which will impact Arm going forward. Why It Matters: It is the largest since Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) went public in 2021, raising about $12 billion. The tech sector has seen a decline in valuations over the past 18 months due to economic uncertainties and rising interest rates. Major tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Samsung, Intel, and TSMC are expected to buy $735 million worth of Arm shares at the IPO price. The roadshow for the IPO kicked off in Baltimore, emphasizing the role of asset manager T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) in significant IPOs.

                "body": "The White House has accused China of implementing a ban on\u00a0Apple Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhones, alleging it to be a retaliatory measure amid the\u00a0ongoing trade tensions\u00a0between the two countries. What Happened:\u00a0On Wednesday, National Security Council spokesman\u00a0John Kirby\u00a0expressed concern, stating that the reported ban on iPhones appears to be part of a pattern of aggressive retaliation by the People\u2019s Republic of China or PRC against U.S. companies,\u00a0reported\u00a0Bloomberg.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re watching this with concern, clearly. It seems to be of a piece \u2014 of the kinds of aggressive and inappropriate retaliation to US companies that we\u2019ve seen from the PRC in the past. That\u2019s what this appears to be,\u201d said Kirby.\u00a0 He added, \u201cThe truth is, we don\u2019t have perfect visibility on exactly what they\u2019re doing and why, and we certainly would call on them to be more transparent about what they\u2019re seeing and what they\u2019re doing,\u201d See Also:\u00a0From Almost Free To $1,000 Off: US Wireless Giants Lure Subscribers With Wild iPhone 15 Promos Previously, it was reported that China plans to expand the ban to state-backed organizations, including several agencies instructing their\u00a0staff not to bring iPhones\u00a0to work, but the country\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman,\u00a0Mao Ning, denied the existence of specific laws and regulations targeting Apple or foreign phone brands.\u00a0\u00a0 Instead, she highlighted the\u00a0importance of security\u00a0and the need for all companies operating in China to comply with its laws and regulations. \u201cWe noticed that there have been many media reports about security incidents concerning Apple phones.\u201d\u00a0 However, this appears to be at odds with the resurgence of the Chinese tech giant\u00a0Huawei, which aligns with the reported iPhone ban. Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0The uncertainty regarding Apple\u2019s status in China, a crucial production base and market for the company, has left investors on edge. With China representing 19% of Apple\u2019s revenue, any unfavorable change in public sentiment could significantly affect the\u00a0company\u2019s overall financial performance. This development coincides with the\u00a0launch of Apple\u2019s latest iPhone 15 models, for which preorders will begin on Friday.\u00a0 Check out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.

                "body": "The latest models of Apple Inc\u2018s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 Pro are garnering attention for their impressive USB-C port, which delivers data transfer speeds that are 20 times faster than the base iPhone 15 models. What Happened: A recent report from Cult of Mac highlighted the superior data transfer speed of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. These models support USB 3.2 Gen 2, which offers a data transfer rate of up to 10GB per second. This starkly contrasts the base iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models that support USB 2.0 and have a maximum data transfer speed of 480MB per second. Despite initial speculations, there\u2019s no Thunderbolt support for the 2023 iPhones. The lack of Thunderbolt implies that the maximum data transfer rate for the new Pro models remains at 10Gbps. See Also: From Almost Free To $1,000 Off: US Wireless Giants Lure Subscribers With Wild iPhone 15 Promos Why It Matters: Apple\u2019s transition to the USB-C port started with the unveiling of the iPhone 15 series at the \u2018Wonderlust\u2019 event. The company had to switch to the USB-C port following the European Union\u2019s mandate that required mobile device makers to adopt the USB-C standard by the end of the year. This move left a few Apple products with its proprietary connector, causing users with Lightning cables to search for a dongle yet again. Despite this, the USB-C port\u2019s enhanced speed proves advantageous for videographers and photographers who deal with large file transfers. The faster data transfer rate allows for quicker unloading of substantial video files, making it an ideal choice for professionals in the field.

                "body": "Along with the iPhone 15, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) brought the much-awaited USB-C port to AirPods as well during the \u2018Wonderlust' launch event. While this means you won't need dongles to charge your iPhone and AirPods now, there is an unfortunate catch \u2013 you will have to shell out $249 for a new pair of AirPods Pro 2. What Happened: Although Apple launched the AirPods Pro 2 with the USB-C port alongside the iPhone 15 series, existing owners of AirPods Pro 2 are out of luck if they want the USB-C charging case. See Also: Apple iPhone 15 Pro Innovation? Nope, Android\u2019s Done It Before: From Action Button To USB-C To 3D Video Recording Going by the list of AirPods accessories that Apple has on sale right now, the USB-C charging case for the AirPods Pro 2 is not available as a standalone purchase. Essentially, existing owners of the AirPods Pro 2 cannot just change their charging case for the USB-C version. If you want one, you will have to pay $249 and get an entirely new pair of AirPods Pro 2 with the USB-C case, which seems like a waste of money for existing owners. Why It Matters: With how closely iPhone and AirPods are used together, having an iPhone with a USB-C port and the Lightning AirPods Pro 2 will mean users will have to either carry the USB-C and Lightning cables separately or carry a USB-C to Lightning adapter that is a $29 purchase. Earlier, when Apple added wireless charging ability to the AirPods (with the AirPods 2), it also sold the wireless charging case separately and allowed original AirPods users to buy and use it with their older earbuds. Forcing users to buy an entirely new pair of AirPods Pro 2 just for the USB-C port could also result in increased e-waste. Either way, existing AirPods users who want the new port are out of luck for now. Image \u2013 Apple Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0Netizens expressed disappointment in Apple\u2019s decision on social media. Some were disappointed, having purchased their AirPods Pro recently, believing that the upgrade would require only USB-C compatibility.\u00a0 Others questioned why Cupertino didn\u2019t enable the feature, suggesting it might have been seen as a marketing opportunity. There was also a sentiment that Apple could have simplified matters by labeling it as a new version, avoiding confusion.
